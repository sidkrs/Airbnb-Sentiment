Her home looked like it was ripped from the pages of Elle Decor; it is an upstairs duplex, quite a charming and delighfully vintage Old Hollywood-style home, with a great location walking distance from the fun shops of Robertson (ladies, gasp!) Sherree is a Martha Stewart of sorts, having the gift to cook, garden, host, and definitely decorate.  The bedroom is lovely and quaint off of the kitchen, with beautiful furnishings and its own bathroom. Sherree is a whiz in the kitchen, and even let me join her for a delicious dinner one night which she amazingly cooked from scratch.

Grace is such a charming, warm and welcoming person with a big, fantastic smile. She was always very helpful and I felt immediately at home. The house is very clean and  my room was spacious with lots of storage space. She provides so many extras which you would not get in a B&B or Hotel. It was great coming home and having the possibility to make myself a tea or cook something. I travalled alone this time and walked home from the bus/tube at night, which felt quite safe. Golders Green/Brent Cross is an interesting area and there are many different ways by bus or tube to get into Central London. Brent Cross Shopping Center is just 10min by foot and the charming old suburban village of Hampstead just one tube stop away. I would love to come back soon and stay with Grace again. ",2010,5.0,joy

Wendy filled us in with everything and ensure that we were settling in well and Mike also ensure that we had a large glass of wine to enjoy before dinner. <br/><br/>Our stay was purely to relax and enjoy the pace of Redonda beach before our final lag of a 3 week vacation ending in New York and I must say we surely did achieve this. Our home from home was surely that, beautiful decorated with warm (we had fresh flowers in every room), cosy and full of charm. I took the opportunity to sit outside every morning to have breakfast something I could rarely achieve back in my own country, England.  <br/><br/>Redonda beach is a four minute walk and is a beautiful beach, Wendy supplied us with beach towels and mats for our duration. We took some amazing pictures from the beach and I do recommend you stay on the beach to see at least one sunset.<br/><br/>All in all we had an amazing stay and not only were they the best host that I ever came across I left with two beautiful friends.<br/><br/>Thank you Mike and Wendy    <br/>  ",2010,5.0,joy

Our first stay was just my wife and I and we were warmly welcomed with cookies and other basics in the kitchen that were so nice after our long drive. <br/><br/>When looking to return to the area, this time with our daughters, we contacted Patricia to see if she would be comfortable with four in the house. Since we had been there before we knew the size of the rooms and knew we could make it work. She was open to the idea and it worked out great for us. We even got in some tennis and threw the ball for her dog. <br/><br/>Patricia and her family were genuinely charming and welcoming.

If you do stay, you must take your time to visit the Beechwood cafe. The Hollywood sign is minutes away as is the walk to the Kodak theatre, it is unbelievable how close the place is to the heart of LA, yet so peaceful.<br/><br/>I stayed at Bamboo for a little under a month and I cannot begin to tell you how magical the place is. Henry and Robert have gone out of there way to accommodate my every request. Simply put, there is nothing they didn't do... the dedication and attention to every minor detail constantly from day to day has been performed with such vigour and precision. They have realised a gem in the heart of the Hollywood Hills that is not seen anywhere else in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Overall, I am there biggest fan and certain that it will remain my favourite destination..

I was in LA for a conference at the convention centre. It generally took me 20 - 30 min door to door, including a 10 min walk to the Vermont/Santamonica subway stop. <br/><br/>The room itself is spacious and relaxing, looking through double french doors to a lovely back garden. Also, you have your own well equipped bathroom right next to the bedroom. <br/><br/>I strongly reccomend staying with Janet.

Parking on the street was mostly not a problem, and if it was then I was allowed to park in the driveway. The fresh baked bread and other snacks/drinks that were provided were great and also unexpected. No television but that was fine with me. I recommend this place primarily as a quiet get away for a single or a couple.

After spending two fantastic/hectic weeks in New York, this was the perfect place to unwind before our long return flight home. The bungalow itself suited our needs perfectly, located in a quiet residential area close to the beach and Redondo Pier. Kincaid's at Redondo Pier provided some wonderful meals in very relaxed surroundings. We travelled to Santa Monica/Venice Beach via bus transport and taxi - found this easy with so many people willing to help and advise - we found the travelling just added to the overall wonderful experience. <br/>Omar was the perfect host, just a really nice guy, so friendly and helpful.

We are in London on a multi-year transfer from the U.S. (Boston) and had been staying in corporate apartments (soul-sucking Chelsea Cloisters), and when our time ran out there we were still a week away from being able to move in to our new (Website hidden by Airbnb) wouldn't let us extend, but we hated it there anyway and I found Lina's place and sent a note.

Even though she was traveling at the time, she was very prompt, which was awesome because we were in such urgent need of settled accommodations because my wife and I have an infant son. The whole week we were there she was always available via email or phone.

And we couldn't have asked for a better host. It felt like staying at a friend's place. The apartment is small but very (VERY) well-organized and clean, with lots of interesting art and books and a great kitchen. (She has an induction stovetop, which is awesome... read the instructions if you've never used one). She has flowers at all the windows and she's top floor so there's always a nice breeze blowing through.

Having an outfitted apartment was so much better than the corporate thing. Just having the cookware and the spices and such. She also had a Bose speaker for iPods/iPhones which was a nice treat.

The location is also fantastic. Close to Portabello Road and lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. She will give you recommendations if you ask.

Later, we left for one day to Malibu, and then came back to stay at one of the cottages for 5 days. We give a 10+++ to everything we found at the Burnham Cottage. Great location next to the beach, board walk, shops, restaurants, yoga, surf (Redondo Rocks!!). Fresh flowers to welcome us back again, nice bath tub, cozy, AWESOME matress...it was just perfect! But I have to say, that what made our stay unforgettable, was meeting Mike and Wendy...they are so nice. They helped us with everything we needed, they had ready a folder with lots of information about the area, and had answers for all of our questions or doubts, really helpfull! A couple with a great sense of humor, caring...they know how to make you feel at home!Personally, I love their way of taking life!Although we were always rushing to do so many things around the area, we had interesting chats with them, they are well travelled which is very interesting too. we had so much fun with them! We also enjoyed, meeting other people staying at their place...nice chats in the evening. We hope to be able to go back soon, and definetly stay at the Burnham Cottage!We feel so lucky of having chosing them!!I´m sure no one would regret staying there!<br/>ENTER AS STRANGERS, LEAVE AS FRIENDS...",2010,5.0,love

I have not met (and I'm no kid!) any other ""B&B"" hosts as welcoming.<br/><br/>The cute ""BBC2"" cottage gets an able 4 stars. What was great? The decor; the 2 blocks from my jog barefoot on the sand; an outside picnic table (in matching blue paint, I might add), the welcoming hammock I wasn't able to try, having a remarkably decent wifi signal in the living space. I was there only 48 hours and was alas disappointed that  the tires of the beach cruisers (I think they have six of 'em!) weren't properly inflated for my longed-for bike ride. I am pretty sure that if I'd stated in advance that I HAD to go for a bike ride, it would've been taken care of rather than hoping two very busy people could drop what they were doing and bring one up to snuff. That said, Michael HAD adjusted my seat for me... we just didn't see that the tire was flat! (Silly us). That's it. Air in tires. The remainder of the experience was, in its brevity, exceedingly good. They've taken historical 100-year-old beach cottages and made 'em as cozy as ya can without obliterating their ambiance.

However, the real standout feature is the wonderful, relaxed down-home way in which Wendy and Mike look after the guests.  Nothing was too much trouble to ensure my two daughters and I enjoyed our stay. We stayed in the cottage for just over a week. Warm, comfortable and cozy.

Her flat is comfortable, homey, very sunny, and quiet at night. Her diverse neighborhood rocks! It's full of excellent eateries of varying ethnicities, good supermarkets, etc., etc. Her place is about a 10-minute walk to the Finsbury Park tube stop, and there are also several buses that ply Stroud Green Road. The Piccadilly and Victoria tube lines that serve Finsbury Park are very dependable and come frequently. My only caveat is if you are unwilling to take 20- to 40-minute commutes to downtown London attractions and money is no object, you will prefer to stay downtown.

We were also able to borrow their beach cruisers to ride along the beach path, which is only two blocks away!  Wendy had a lot of great suggestions regarding restaurants and things to do in the area as well.  And, their gorgeous furry friends, Freedom and Spright, are the sweetest and most lovely of animal friends.  I felt like we were staying with family!<br/><br/>Second, the cottage and the property are AMAZING.  Wendy and Mike have done a wonderful job creating a relaxing, romantic and beach inspired space in which you feel right at home.  The bed was super comfortable, the deep tub very relaxing and the entire place was spotless.  The porch and shared outdoor space were great amenities to have.  You can leave your cottage door open and just sit on the porch with a cup of coffee for hours listening to the birds.  Really, it is that serene and lovely of a place.  AND, again, the location is perfect for beach lovers.  You can run along the beach easily and ride the bikes all over the area.  There is a CVS a block away for all those last minute things you might have forgotten and an abundant amount of restaurants-all within walking distance.<br/><br/>In all, we had a FABULOUS time and will never stay anywhere else on our trips to LA. <br/><br/>Thank you Wendy and Mike!",2010,4.0,joy

I have not met (and I'm no kid!) any other ""B&B"" hosts as welcoming.<br/><br/>The cute ""BBC2"" cottage gets an able 4 stars. What was great? The decor; the 2 blocks from my jog barefoot on the sand; an outside picnic table (in matching blue paint, I might add), the welcoming hammock I wasn't able to try, having a remarkably decent wifi signal in the living space. I was there only 48 hours and was alas disappointed that  the tires of the beach cruisers (I think they have six of 'em!) weren't properly inflated for my longed-for bike ride. I am pretty sure that if I'd stated in advance that I HAD to go for a bike ride, it would've been taken care of rather than hoping two very busy people could drop what they were doing and bring one up to snuff. That said, Michael HAD adjusted my seat for me... we just didn't see that the tire was flat! (Silly us). That's it. Air in tires. The remainder of the experience was, in its brevity, exceedingly good. They've taken historical 100-year-old beach cottages and made 'em as cozy as ya can without obliterating their ambiance.

I can't think of a better way to relax, reunite, and enjoy the last week of 2010 than spending it on the 'compound' with Mike, Wendy and family!  <br/>With the Pier and beach literally right around the corner, the eclectic mix of restaurants and proximity to nearly everything LA, it's an ideal location for anyone. <br/>With bikes provided, you can ride up the Strand (boardwalk ) as far as Santa Monica if you'd like; however, as I experienced myself on this trip, Marina Del Ray might be far enough (roundtrip it's a good 27 miles). Regardless, endless beach cities dot the nearby coastline and are in easy access with Hermosa and Manhattan just a few miles up the road. <br/>And if the rare rainy day should rear it's ugly head, the Torrence Mall is just a 10 minute bus ride (#7 Longbeach but don't hold me to that), as well as plenty of other shopping/indoor experiences in any direction, inculding all of downtown LA. <br/>Third time was a charm!  Thanks again Stewarts for everything, you're hospitality, geniune nature, and homey accomodations create an atmosphere - no matter the weather - that is always comfortable and warm. <br/><br/>All the best, <br/><br/>Juris",2010,4.0,joy

Her flat is really quite lovely. It's sort of like staying in one of those little demo apartments Ikea builds in their stores and labels something like ""A whole apartment in 500 square feet!"". Except Lina has much better art and a heck of a lot more books.

That's not to say the apartment is small. It's a real one bedroom with a nice little kitchen and a good sized living room. The bedroom is cozy and the bed is quite comfortable. 

Lina was a fantastic host. Before my arrival she coordinated with me and arranged for a taxi to pick me up at the airport. The night I arrived she took me out for a stroll to show me around the neighborhood and gave me plenty of advice on what to do, where to eat and how to get around. Way better than any hotel concierge.

Regardless, endless beach cities dot the nearby coastline and are in easy access with Hermosa and Manhattan just a few miles up the road. <br/>And if the rare rainy day should rear it's ugly head, the Torrence Mall is just a 10 minute bus ride (#7 Longbeach but don't hold me to that), as well as plenty of other shopping/indoor experiences in any direction, inculding all of downtown LA. <br/>Third time was a charm!

We were also able to borrow their beach cruisers to ride along the beach path, which is only two blocks away!

Wendy and Mike have done a wonderful job creating a relaxing, romantic and beach inspired space in which you feel right at home.

You can leave your cottage door open and just sit on the porch with a cup of coffee for hours listening to the birds.  Really, it is that serene and lovely of a place.

Janet was super friendly and welcoming and always happy to help.  There were a few teathing problems; v.weak internet reception and it was a bit sparten but I made it my own and Janet was very open to hear what has made my stay extra pleasant at other vacation homes.  Anything that did crop up, Janet was on it in a instant.  She was nearing completion of the landscaping to the deck area.  It will be fab when complete.<br/><br/>I am confident the Nook will keep on improving as a great destination as her experiences unfold.  Please note the property is quite dark but Janet did mention the fading avocado tree outside may be for the chop.<br/><br/>Janet is a gem.  Thanks.",2010,4.0,joy

What Jay forgot to say is, that the room is very loud as trucks speed at the street during the whole night. You need to leave the window open, as it is pretty warm. I don't know where the pictures of the presented room came from, but not from the room I was staying in... <br/>Mine had a lonley bed and a table. NO curtains at the window, so bring your own....or women, if you like some privacy don't go there. And you better bring your own WLAN...

It is really central to all directions that you might want to go, plus it is close to Griffith Park which is a great getaway.<br/><br/>The apartment had everything we needed, including a bottle of wine, snacks, spices, fruit, and the list goes on.  Plenty of room for us and a 4 year old, and laundry made it so we could pack lightly.  The neighborhood is great to walk around and has a nice small market and casual cafe/diner within a couple of blocks.  It is a VERY pleasant walk, as is any walk around the neighborhood, especially in the evening.  Evenings even include the sound of coyotes, not to mention we saw one.  It really was the coolest neighborhood, and if you ever got lost you always knew to head to the Hollywood sign.<br/><br/>Finally, Elen was a great host.

The living room is sparsely but tastefully decorated, and the bedroom is very nice; both are furnished with beautiful and simple pieces from around the world. The living room gets lots of light and the whole place was spotless.<br/><br/>The limitations of this place are that it seems much better for the visitor passing through than a long-term guest (I was there for two weeks). The living room only had a couch and a slightly beat up dining table and two chairs both in disrepair. There were no hangers in the closet when I got there, and the kitchen was lacking some very basic amenities like ice trays, garbage bags, or a corkscrew. (The wifi was down for the first few days I was there, but Phoebe worked hard to get it back up, and was responsive and helpful the whole time.) More important, though, is that the unit is underneath several other much larger apartments and the walls and floors are thin, so noise--just the noise of living--can be an issue if you're sleeping or geting up early.<br/><br/>So, if you're not sensitive to noise and don't plan on doing much cooking or entertaining, I highly recommend this place.

I felt tremendously welcomed in her home and Elisabetta made every effort to make my stay pleasant - from the neat room, solid breakfasts, great suggestions on events/sites, providing maps and engaging in meaningful conversations. 

The area itself is very well-served by different modes of transportation (bicycle, bus and tube; the latter is an est 10 min promenade away). But the best thing about the location is that it is a stone's throw away from the Southern bank of the Thames and with some comfortable shoes and nice weather, you could easily walk to several key London sites (London Eye, Tate Modern, Big Ben, House of Parliament, etc). 

The room itself is small and cute, but with plenty of smart storage solutions. The bathroom is great, with a nice warm shower and Elisabetta provides high-quality towels and linens to her guests. I was also welcomed to use the other rooms in the house, like the office where I used Elisabetta's computer for internet access.

It is because of people like Elisabetta that I feel very comfortable with recommending Airbnb to others and if you are going to London, I'd definitely suggest that you consider Elisabetta's place! I hope that I get a chance to visit her again!

The place was perfectly comfortable and Philippa gave a lot of helpful information prior to our arrival in England.

However, me and my girlfriend were robbed the second night we were there.  We went out to meet friends and by the time we got back, all of our valuables were taken (computers, iPods, camera equipment, jewelry, etc).  It was upon the arrival of the police that we learned two things:
1)  Rooms here are rented out very, very frequently.  There are always people in and out so it is very obvious that there are tourists coming in and out of here.
2) The locks, as explained by the police, are very inadequate at this location and can be circumvented with extremely simple tactics.

The most aggravating part of this was how we were treated.  We followed all instructions exactly as they were laid out and were very deliberate in making sure everything was perfectly secure as we went in and out of the place.  However, all correspondence with Philippa (through email or through her neighbor) indicated nothing other than it somehow being our fault.  There was very little sympathy and all the commentary centered around what WE did.  Additionally, Philippa basically just stopped replying to emails after we expressed how frustrated we were from her responses and the lack of security and safety in the building.

So, it is a nice place and a convenient location, but the threat of robbery (or God forbid attacks) is just simply too high here.",2011,4.0,joy

Guest house is beautiful and modern, and packed with a good sized mini-fridge, microwave, toaster oven, blender, and crockpot.  Enjoyed breakfast each morning on the patio.  It was a perfect way to start out our morning before heading out to explore LA.  Location was also perfect.  We were 10 minutes from Santa Monica pier, close to the PCH, 10 minutes from downtown LA.  Jen's family was more that accommodating, and happy to give directions, and suggestions.  This would be an ideal spot for families traveling with small children, as there is an enormous park right across the street.  This was our first airbnb experience, and Jen set the bar very, very high.  This location is highly recommended!  ",2011,5.0,joy

The place is located in lovely Chelsea, seconds away from scores of shops, restaurants and pubs.  There is also a supermarket and cinema literally right around the corner.  If your only in London a few days and are primarily sight-seeing, the place is within walking distance to two metro stations and two or three tube stops to Westminister, Soho and Southbank  (about 20 mins total time).   A really great option for quick and easy access to central London with a quieter, trendy and less tourist neighbourhood to come home too.  And for anyone traveling from North America, London public transit is an absolute dream in comparison.

Wireless internet also a plus.<br/><br/>A few things that you wouldn't know from the other reviews.  First, the place wasn't very clean- the floors were rather dirty and there was a decent amount of hair on the shower floor.  Second, the shower itself was only about 5' off the ground, which is fine if you are very short but makes showering a serious challenge for someone of average height.  Third, there is very little privacy of the bathroom (you can hear everything throughout the house), which is a consideration if you're sharing the place with someone else.  Lastly, the place doesn't get a lot of light and has a musty smell (to be sure, for us this added a certain amount of charm).  This also wasn't much of an issue since we were out so much and the place is in a very convenient location.<br/><br/>Parking worked pretty well on the street, but two of the three nights of our stay we had to park on the next block over since there was nothing available on Martel.",2011,4.0,sadness

Tube and bus communications with city center are very good: Kilburn Park Underground Station and Queen's Park are only 5 minutes by walk.

Corbin and Kendall provide their guests with such an amazing experience it is hard to ever stay in a hotel again. It felt more like staying with close friends and they will be my top choice of places to stay everytime I return to LA. Arriving to their place after a long plane ride, it was such a welcome sight to see my fridge stocked with a cheese plate (where else are u going to find a cheese plate! Awesome!) and juices and oatmeal in the cupboards. I loved the little open deck and it was nice to be able to run outside and have breakfast in the mornings or just chill for a couple min.  Its so nice to come home to your own apartment at the end of the day and not feel the cold blase feeling you get from staying in hotels. I never took the opportunity to use the bikes, but its nice to know that they were available to use.  Their place is easily accessible to numerous beaches, the airport and an abundance of other activities. Kendall also has a wealth of knowledge about delicious restaurants in the area, so make sure to pick her brain when your starved! They are both available anytime u want to talk or when u come home excited about your day and just want to ramble on about all the amazing things u did. All in all this was an awesome experience!

We were given the freedom to come and go as we pleased. Wonderful breakfast – at the disposal of the guests in the fridge were eggs, ham, various fruitjuices, cereals, yoghurt, etc etc. Nice to be able to cook something at night as well. We were even given the use of the salon if we wanted, which we didn't because London has so much to offer, but the thought was lovely. (I myself forgot to ask, but if you want to use internet, be sure to bring a laptop.)
An ample 5 minutes walk from tube station Brent Cross (about 25 minutes from tube Leicester Square), and from a huge Tesco supermarket (good and well priced) that is almost continuously open (to be reached via a tunnel under the motorway). We didn't try the bus connections in the neighbourhood but to our knowledge they are plenty and there might even be a night service.
Hop off some time at tube Hampstead – very recommendable neighbourhood with a 'Charles Dickens' atmosphere in the sidestreets and beautiful historic properties which seem unchanged for centuries, pubs (Holly Bush).

He goes out of his way to ensure his guests have everything they need while also managing to be totally unobtrusive. He even emailed me before I arrived to ask if there was anything special I'd like him to have in the fridge for my arrival - that's going the extra mile and is indicative of the care and regard Ciaran has for his guests. 
The location is great, everything you could possibly wish for is either in the immediate area or within very easy reach from Ciaran's place. Public transport options are plentiful and again, very close by. The room itself is a great size and the bed is one of the most comfy beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in!

He is a lovely, friendly person and a gracious host. His dog, Jerome, is a treasure. Cairan knows London and has lots of helpful information at hand. His apartment is comfortable, clean and spacious. The only limitation is that there is no living room to relax in because both rooms are being used as bedrooms. It was not a problem for us and it was comfortable to sit in the kitchen when we wanted to be out of our room. Location is ideal, 2 blocks from the Kilburn underground stop, 1 block from Bromdesbury overground stop, a block from the Sainsbury supermarket and several ethnic groceries (middle eastern, asian). West Hampstead is a 5 or 7 minute walk, in the other direction on Iverson–it's a bit more upscale than Kilburn but a lot duller.

99241,581537,2011-09-29,511586,Ingrid,"I loved staying here, but it's not for everyone.
 The apartment is  filled with light, with a view over London rooftops, and lovely tree lined side streets. Jean and Nicholas are charming hosts. I didn't mind at all that the room is tiny, but some might.. The design is planned so that lovely large mirrors make it seem much bigger. The bathroom is down half a flight of stairs, not that easy if you are up a few times during the night, but not hard to get used to.

 I arrived by train from Heathrow, and found the tube exit a little bit daunting. I'm 67, and there was no escalator or lift. The street outside the tube was scruffy, and I had some early misgivings, but if you love diverse neighborhoods with lots of authentic ethnic food, this is for you. There are Moroccan, Lebanese, Turkish, Galician, Brazilian and Portuguese restaurants within a ten minute walk from the apartment, and in the local provisions stores, everyone is speaking the language of the provisions. I was surprised by the number of Moslem women in black with head scarves.
In some ways, the neighborhood is like what the East Village used to be like, except the houses are prettier. It's a short walk to Portobello Road where you can enjoy being fleeced, and I walked through the adjacent neighborhoods of Notting Hill and Bayswater through Hyde Park all the way to Kn ightsbridge, Albert Hall and Harrod's, which really took me through the gamut of social classes. It's about an hour's walk if you don't stop to eat, look, sit on park benches, etc. so it took me three hours. The walk through Hyde Park is a must.
The bus to Hyde Park corner is across the street from the apartment, and takes about twenty minutes, going through a number of lovely neighborhoods, moving up on social class as you proceed.

I'll happily return here. And hope that others will who have a similar mentality. You don't have to be young, but you do need an open mind and open heart.",2011,3.0,love

This was my first airbnb experience and I feel incredibly fortunate that it was with these amazing gentlemen.  Not only is the flat a feast for the eyes, the room is cosy, comfortable and has everything one could need.  It feels like a small, designer hotel room and even more so with Jean and Nico insisting upon coming in and freshening the bed each day, (though I protested it was not necessary, I secretly loved coming back to a freshly made bed!)  

The breakfasts Jean creates are delicious and healthy and our conversations while I indulged were always entertaining, informative and comfortable.

They were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful with exploring the city and how to get places, which was a wonderful bonus as I had never been to London and needed both ideas for how to spend some leisure time and how to get to specific places at appointed times.

I have only wonderful memories of my stay at Portobello Room and feel as though I have two new friends in Nico and Jean.

Though I wasn't at the house too often, the times when she and I were there, we had great conversations about design, music, business, photography, etc. Our talks were very inspiring to me.<br/><br/>I turned to AirBnB because I was stuck in a rut. My plans to stay at my friend's place fell through and I didn't want to change the dates I booked for my vacation. I chose Julie's place because of the inexpensive rate and the creative room aspect intrigued me. I'm so glad I chose it because it was worth the great experience. If I were I LA again, and was in the same situation, I would totally go to Julie again. Even if I already have a place to stay, if I had the opportunity I would come just to visit. Totally recommended!",2011,5.0,joy

My only suggestion if you are a woman alone at night, is to take a cab home.

The flat is situated on the last floor of a Victorian building with wonderful views from every window. My personal favorite was the view from one window looking out over some neighboring roofs with all the little chimneys - so lovely and old fashioned bohemian. The room although small has everything you can wish for plus they were kind enough to make their living room available to us as well. Nicolas is a designer and artist and it shows throughout the thoughtfully decorated flat where some of his paintings and especially his fantastic design of woven fabric is displayed. Jean, a chef, handpicks the ingredients for breakfast and prepares everything with great love for detail. If you want to delight your senses just taste and smell the ""fresh fruit with a twist"" he serves (I let you find out for yourself what the twist is). The food was always delicious, the flat extraordinarily clean and comfy. Jean and Nicolas are thoughtful, respectful, interesting and caring individuals; they are a delight to be around. I genuinely enjoyed our conversations. My niece jokingly commented ""everything was picobello at Portobello"". And indeed everything was of highest quality.

The room was a nice, bright, private room with a small shower and sink/toilet for our own use, nice duvet and sheets, and a pleasant view of the back garden below. Matthew gave us keys so we could come and go as we pleased, but we were always greeted with a hello and his taking time to listen to our adventures.  Just the right amount of interaction for us.  We would definitely stay with Matthew again.  The room was right on the Northern line with super easy connection to the Bakerloo and Central/District lines, just a minute walk from the Oval station, so we got around easily and quickly on our Zone 1,2 daily passes.

It also has a very nice high green wall of shrubbery which further buffers you from the street. When you're on the porch it feels like you are in a nice little garden, but with all the amenities of a city within a 2 minute walk. <br/><br/>The place is nice, it is exactly as shown in the pictures, a cottage on the beach, and it has laundry..which is huge.

I could seriously write for paragraphs and paragraphs about how positive my epxerience was but I will first say very affirmatively that the next time I come to London I am staying here for several reasons. What are those reasons? First off the price was beyond excellent, compared to the rates most of the apartments or rooms were charging this was a complete bargain at $50 USD for one evening. Second was the location, easily accessible to bus lines and the underground to get to anywhere that I would need to get to in London. Third was the comfort of the room and the bed. I had just flown over from the states and wanted to take a short nap before I got the rest of the day started. I was hesitant knowing that I would be sleeping in a sofabed which have not been good experiences in the past and my back condition doesn't like them, but this was totally different, I fell asleep immediately and slept like a baby during my nap and the evening. The room was great and so was the rest of the apartment, sort of what I envisioned a small flat in London being like so that was a surprise for my first visit to the UK. And the fourth and final reason was the host, Tessa could not have been more accommodating, kind, generous and genuinely sweet during my stay. The communication was great before I got there and even during my stay, even offering to help out if I needed anything after I had left and continued my stay in London at another location. She also was very kind to order a fabulous meal from a local chef because she knew I didn't know the area well, my friend had not arrived for the rest of my trip and I wanted to get to bed early so this was a great option to eat at her place. We literally talked for almost three hours about my life, her life, London, among a host of other topics. I feel like I gained a friend, not just a great place to stay if I get the chance to come back to London. I would so highly recommend this place if you are staying in London, whether by yourself, or a couple or a few friends that it would be silly to spend more money somewhere else. Don't let the fact that the apartment owner is there with you, which she is not always but was during my stay, deter you from staying here. Tessa made it completely known that she would stay out of my way if I wanted it, which it turned out I didn't, it was great just sitting and talking with her and learning about someone's life and the great city that she lived in.

Teresa and Nassim were both very, very kind and offered me advice on where to eat, and went out of their way to make sure I was staying comfortably. They were great hosts, and I have nothing but praises for them, but the apartment itself could not match their standards. The apartment is smaller than it looks in the pictures and is quite hot, especially in August. Unlike the larger house, it has no AC and gets very warm at night without a fan. Although the house was cleaned when I arrived, the couches were slightly worn and a bit dirty, and a small group of ants clustered around the bathroom sink. The beds were decently comfortable, but it was almost impossible to sleep because all the neighbors seemed to have dogs that would bark at each other throughout the night, every night. It would have been a bit better with the windows closed, but because of the heat, I had to leave them open. There is tandem parking right in front of the apartment,which is shared with the house in front and the other apartment right next door, so sometimes you need to play a bit of cat and mouse to find out who is blocking the driveway. This is a lovely apartment to stay in if you are not sensitive to noise, and can deal with the heat.

Being able to eat our meals outside, swim in and relax by the lovely pool, hike around the grounds and rest in the comfort of the cottage made for a wonderful and memorable time.  The days were filled with warm sun amongst eucalyptus mountains and starry nights shared with a symphony of crickets, owls and coyotes.  And again...This is in Los Angeles!<br/><br/>The cottage itself is gorgeous.  Open and spacious.  Excellent kitchen space, storage and gear for any and all home-cooking needs (patio with table and chairs for meals with scenic mountain views just outside the kitchen).  Comfortable living room area, cozy bedroom with comfortable bed, and fine bathroom/shower.  All presented to us, super clean and in working order.  There were also a wide variety of books (kid's books too!) to glance through as well.<br/><br/>Our kind host, Lynn,  treated us very well, respecting our privacy and making sure all was OK the few times we did cross paths.  <br/><br/>We feel so fortunate to have experienced a holiday at the ""Secret Cottage"" and will always remember our time together in a setting so unique and different from a typical Los Angeles stay.

Their comments were as follows:  The bed is small and pushed up against a wall, so it made for difficult extractions in the middle of the night for the person against the wall.  They wished the bed situation was better.  Also, the sink is small and without a counter so it makes for some challenges getting ready.

The location is fantastic so close to central London, the Tube, Overland trains, buses and the shopping, restaurants and local pubs all easily accessible by foot, and all most enjoyable as well.

The flat  has everything you could wish for, and with a choice of supermarkets so close by the in-house catering as supplied by ourselves was always great. Whilst it was cold and wet while we where in London, the flat was warm to come home to everyday, and we did not have to turn on central heating once. For those of you who enjoy your music, you can even go to soundcloud and search for Sarah Stanton and listen to some of Sarah's songs, how nice to know you are staying at a flat owned by someone so talented.

Sarah is a fantastic host, and on the day of arrival she helped us out with our bags until the flat was ready for us and then drove us over to the flat so we did not have to carry the bags, how awesome is that!

I actually rented a studio but due to a double booking, Andrea upgraded me to the 1bd apt (http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/358575) in the same lot. The apt was very clean - exactly as she described and Andrea was a great host. The location offers ample street parking (which is very rare in LA), awesome cafe around the corner(which offers Intelligentsia coffee) and located in great proximity to all of East LA.

296379,3141154,2012-12-23,3084625,Barbara,"Cyth & Anthn are wonderful, generous hosts.  Their space in West Hollywood is one of the most magic and authentic places in all of LA.  That alone would have been enough to highly recommend them….in addition they are 2 of the best hosts we’ve met.  We stayed for 4 nights and each day it was a feast for the eyes, the mind, and the heart.  They are both artists and there were little creative discoveries all over… placed with care and taste. We connected with the animals and with their community – we were even invited to a neighborhood party which was a total highlight!  They lead the kind of life – infused with friends and art – that I was honored to have my daughter witness and hopefully create in her own life.<br/><br/>Clearly Cyth and Anthn attract hip, artistic people because the guest book was full of reliable recommendations for food/outings nearby. Perfect outings nearby with top class cafes and galleries and shopping.   You will be blown away if you are an animal lover as each animal is healthy and living the good life.  Our room was amazing and we had the best sleep of the trip on a very comfortable bed.  If you come, come with an open heart and I have no doubt you will be amazed. Can’t wait to return!<br/>",2012,5.0,joy

Check-in was efficient, kellie organized it nicely. It was a large House, large backyard, nice people, nice dog.

It was weird, the first two days I parked there, no problem; then the last day, I received a parking tickets stating ""no parking during 7-9a.m."" or something like that.

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the house, location and Patricia herself!<br/><br/>First of all, this location (Point Dume) is the absolute best in Malibu. You won't believe how lucky you'll feel that you get to stay there. The Point is beautiful, serene, still slightly rural but in a cool Malibu way and the ocean is just minutes away! Grocery store, coffee shop, bank etc are all nearby.<br/><br/>The guest house itself is lovely: large, clean and it has a beautiful view. It's a joy opening the blinds in the morning and to see the hills. It has a full kitchen, large bedroom and bathroom, plenty of storage.<br/>The environment is so nice & calm, you'll feel very relaxed - though if it's dining & shopping you're after, the Malibu Country Mart is a short drive  away, as is the Farmer's Market on Sundays. <br/><br/>Patricia is extremely welcoming and will make you feel right at home. She's always there for you if you have any questions or need any help, but also very happy to let you do your thing and enjoy your stay.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this Guest House enough. You will not find a better deal or place in this area!! And it's truly a privilege to be able to stay in the area at all.<br/><br/>Big thanks to Patricia!!!",2012,5.0,joy

107051,828575,2012-01-03,652329,Scott,"We just got back to California after spending Christmas and New Year aboard Jessie.  We loved our time on the boat.  Meg is a wonderful hostess and very accommodating. She managed to moor the boat in the place we had requested (Liitle Venice, one block fom Warwick Avenue tube station), met us upon arrival and even had a small Christmas tree waiting to greet us. When we told her we were planning to cook Christmas dinner on the boat, Meg recommended the Waitrose supermarket nearby where we bought everything we needed.  Our nephew and two friends --- students in London spending the Holidays away from their families --- came for dinner and we all had a great time.
We loved the location and were greeted every morning by the geese, ducks and swans. They added a wonderful dimension to our stay. The boat is very comfortable for two people (and probably for a small family as well) and is quite elegant. We were asked by a few people if they could take a picture next to it :)
Those considering a stay aboard Jessie should remember that this is not a hotel room or a flat. It's a boat. You have to run the engine twice a day for hot water and to charge the batteries, and lighting the fire on cold days may require extra time in the morning. But we didn't mind. On the contrary, we found a lot of pleasure in carrying out these boat tasks. 
We highly recommend it if you want to experience London from a different lens.

580534,2620769,2012-10-15,302542,Matt,"All in all, it's a wonderful value, a charming flat in a perfect location, excellent amenities ... some potentially off-putting quirks.

I'll start with the apartment: It's a story in itself. The pictures don't lie; it's filled with curios from the life and travels of your gregarious and eccentric host. All the features of the flat are in great working order - strong hot water with great pressure in the shower, a good washer, etc. If the smell of smoke bothers you, note that there's a strong smoky odor in the living room which permeated the luggage we kept there - it's mostly unnoticeable from the bedroom and bathroom, however. The most unusual feature of the apartment is the host's collection of 47 clocks, settled everywhere you can think of, ticking constantly and cuckooing at random moments. It didn't bother us too much, but if you're sensitive to background noise, you'll go crazy. And it's up 3 flights of stairs - a fairly minor inconvenience. 

Next, the location: It's perfect - just off of Regent Park and close to several Tube lines, it never took more than 20 minutes to take the Underground to any major attraction. There's also a nearby gym, several grocery stores, a pharmacy, and good pubs all around. You're also a block away from the terrific Indian food on Drummond St.

Last, the host: As I've said, Les is a gregarious man, talkative and pleasant. Two unfortunate incidents mar what was a pretty nice stay, all in all. First, sleeping in late the penultimate morning of our stay, we awoke suddenly to find Les entering the bedroom. He apologized profusely, saying he hadn't realized we were there. But he apparently objected to the fact that he found our laundry drying while we slept, although he had raised no objection to our use of the washer when we asked about it. (There's no dryer, which is common in the UK, so we used the drying rack, as he'd indicated we should. I still don't understand the miscommunication here.)

Lastly, we returned to find a regretful complaint from the host indicating, as best as I can tell, that we hadn't emptied the trash bins in the kitchen and bathroom. (We also did not launder the sheets and tablecloths upon leaving or scrub the bathtub or kitchen sink, although everything was left tidy - sheets folded, dishes washed and dried, etc.) In retrospect, we realized that he had pointed out the key to the trash bin 3 floors below, but given that none of the trash bins was at capacity, we hadn't inferred this was an expectation rather than an option. 

This was unusual and unfortunate, and I chalk both of these incidents up to cultural miscues and miscommunication. I don't think they should prevent you from renting Les' flat. But be aware of these peccadilloes, and make sure you're clear on his expectations for use of the flat before you do.",2012,4.0,joy

The fridge was stocked with orange juice and beers, while he also left out croissants and an assortment of fruit for us.

The location is cool as well. The neigborhood seems quite diverse, and Walworth Ave (the main street just off of Mike's apt.) has loads of small African/Caribbean/other types of restaurants. It's about a 45 minute walk to London Bridge, and about an hour to Covent Garden area. Alternatively, the tube from Kennington takes you to Leicester square in less than ten minutes, which is quite central.

You have supermarkets 24/7 just around the corner, pharmacies and the underground within walking distance, and if you are too tired you can take the buses 6, 7 or 159 and they will drop you on Oxford Street...

The neighbourhood is nice, a lot of nationalities as you walk by.

The kitchen is flawless but we missed the microwave, but instead we used the oven.

The towels and linens were just perfect, but be careful with the carpet cause it leaves little  threads in the socks and cloths, but nothing to worry about if you have one of those hair removers.

The paddington station is near and you can walk 15 minutes or take a cab for 5 pounds.

The hair dryer for the ladies is very useful and it works perfectly, as well as the iron.

It was only my husband and I, so for 2 is perfect.

118805,1046261,2012-03-26,1870544,Thomas,"Buchung, Bestätigung und Beziehen des Zimmer extrem unkompliziert. Wie Richie in der Hausordnung schreibt:
""Relax and enjoy yourself.""
Das Zimmer ist nicht besonders gross. Für zwei Personen perfekt. Mit drei Personen kann es etwas eng werden. Aber für mich ist das kein Problem. Die Betten waren frisch bezogen und Badetücher lagen auch bereit. Im Kühlschrank standen drei Flaschen Wasser und eine kleine Milch bereit. Das Fenster ist auf die Strasse ausgerichtet und der Verkehrslärm ist wahrnehmbar, aber nicht störend. 
Das Appartement liegt mitten im Zentrum. Sämtliche Attraktionen wie Picadilly Circus, Covent Garden, British Museum und viele mehr sind in kürzester Zeit (auch zu Fuss) erreichbar. Auch Gegenden wie Camden Town erreicht man sehr schnell, da sich die Tube höchstens 100 Meter neben der Wohnung befindet.
Die Hotels in dieser Gegend kosten mindestens das Doppelte. Und wenn sie nur zweimal so viel kosten, dann sind sie oft schäbig und beschäftigen unfreundliches Personal.

Also:
Wer schnell und einfach eine günstige Gelegenheit zum Übernachten mitten in London sucht, der sollte hier zugreifen.

Ich zitieren noch einmal Richie:
Relax and enjoy yourself!",2012,3.0,joy

The view is absolutely breathtaking and probably my favorite thing about the stay. <br/><br/>Darrell's place looks exactly like it does in the photos.  It was really hard to leave.

The studio was beautifully clean, looked just like the photos, and was the perfect amount of space for two people.  When checking us in, Alessandro gave us a map of the city, telling us of lots of unique places to visit that we would have never thought of, and answered any questions we had.  He also graciously left us a lovely bottle of wine, and the complementary breakfast was also a nice touch.  The small kitchen was perfect for cooking in one night when we were exhausted from sight-seeing and just needed some ""down-time.""  For first time London visitors, the location was perfect... right in the heart of Victoria, moments away from the tube and 24 BUS that took us wherever we needed to go.

The apartment was gorgeous and exactly how it looks in the photos - perfect for a single or couple.

Don't let that deter you from the amazing, convenient location, off-street parking and wonderful apartment.  The neighborhood is a foodie's dream, a stone's throw from great shopping and very central if visiting other LA neighborhoods.

Walking the hallways to the front door, you can't help but want to dress in tightly-fitting dresses and clap down the hallways in heels.  But bring your ear plugs for sleeping because it is loud at night from the streets.  It never really gets dark in the room, either, so bring your eye cover shield thing as well.  Our dog was welcome there and that made our trip much easier, thank you. She loved it and was very relaxed.  But neighborhood parks are more for the homeless and pigeons, so we escaped by car to Griffith Park to walk her.  We saw oodles of homeless people and they far out number the ""regular"" people on foot downtown.  But Rob's place has a fantastic restaurant on the first floor, and because of his parking garage, it's easy to come and go.  You will need to eat out since the loft has no pots or pans or cooking tools, just a few forks, knives, and spoons.  No microwave.  Think of it as a really large hotel room that smells really good every time you walk in.  I loved the vanilla candle scent. Rob was always communicative and responsive.  Thank you!  ",2013,4.0,joy

Amir and his son (I believe) Roni were very responsive and helpful to what amounted to a few minor problems.  If you are staying here for vacation, I think the location is excellent: equidistant between the West side (Santa Monica, Brentwood) and Hollywood / Downtown, and very close to Century City / Beverly Hills.  Don't expect a lot of great places to walk to for dinner (except the El Gallito food truck on Santa Monica and Westwood, or unless you are a Persian food fanatic - this part of town is known as Tehrangeles), but there is a local Peets / Starbucks for morning coffee and you can get going in your car after that.  The unit is reasonably quiet but it's an efficiency, so it's doubtful you will use it for more than a jumping off point.

Check-in was relatively easy, even though we got in very late (or very early) after visiting with family. Wendell was a great host: he was accommodating, communication was a breeze, and there was even a tray in our room with an assortment of packaged toiletries (like a hotel!). The room was very clean and it's private entrance was a huge plus. We didn't feel like we were inconveniencing Wendell when we were going in and out. The bed was very comfortable and I didn't even realize it was an air bed until the next day! The bathroom is shared, with an entrance from the hall and one from the master bedroom, but it was never a bathroom-use conflict issue. The next morning, Wendell offered us coffee or tea and showed us out when we left. <br/><br/>The only issues I had here were with the bathroom. Though it was extremely clean and very spacious (there's a double vanity where one side is completely clear and dedicated to guests), I really hope he fixes the seal on the shower door, because it floods the ENTIRE bathroom when you take a shower. He was aware of this but didn't let us know ahead of time and I ended up panicking the next morning, sopping up water and changing out floor mats for 10 minutes before I got dressed. Afterwards, when I told him, he said, ""Yeah, that happens sometimes, the door doesn't seal properly, sorry"". Also, the shower drain was clogged, so the water ended up pooling around my ankles (but that wasn't the cause of the flooding).

958435,3733778,2013-03-09,5321058,Audrey,"No doubt our stay in Venice will be the highlight of our trip. This was my first time using Airbnb and I will not hesitate to use this site again for future trips. The house billed as ""luxury modern"" is just that. It exceeded our expectations and then some. 3 floors of spacious luxury. There were 6 of us on this trip and the house afforded us all the amenities, space, and privacy we were seeking. My husband and I stayed in the huge luxurious master suite complete with balcony and equally large bathroom with dual showers, loved it! Our adult children and companions were  all very pleased with the accommodations as well. All bedrooms are large with very comfortable bedding and balconies. Sliding glass doors everywhere allow the house to flow with the refreshing ocean breeze. There is a 3rd floor deck complete with couches, fire pit and shading. We had cocktails up there and enjoyed the vast view and sunset each night. The main living area was amazing as well. Huge comfy couch, large screen TV, wall to wall floor to ceiling glass walls that opened to the private patio, which we all enjoyed. I also fell in love with the tranquility of the lush water wall in the dining area. If you prefer to cook in (we didnt have time) the kitchen is a cooks dream. I cannot say enough positives about this home, just that you will not be disappointed and feel like you are a celebrity when you stay there. The area is great. We walked everywhere. Straight down Washington to the beach a short walk , there are a plethora of choices for local dining. My favorite was the Terrace where we sat open air facing the beach while enjoying a great breakfast. We walked the canals which have some amazing homes and views and really had fun at the 4th street Promenade for lunch and wonderful shopping. The entire city is very eclectic, interesting and fun. I dont want to leave out Abbot Kinney and Venice boardwalk, again just a short walk away. We visited local galleries, shopped with local artisans and basically ate our way across town stopping in for local treats. My only regret is that our time there was so short. Had I known how wonderful the home and area would be, I would have planned to stay longer as there was so much more we wanted to do and not enough time. I would recommend this home and a stay in Venice to anyone searching for luxury and a very good time at the beach. Just though I would mention I had to call the owner Ray with a quick question. He was so easy to reach, very nice and helpful and gave me so many great suggestions to help maximize our time spent in Venice. We will absolutely be booking here again! ",2013,5.0,joy

Connections are excellent; Stratford station is a short walk away and from there there's a central line underground right into London center. The nearby shopping mall is amazing in itself and you'll find everything you need nearby.
The flat was clean and tidy when we arrived, Mil had even arranged some breakfast for us and gave us all the information we needed to settle in.
I like to cook and apart from all the pots and pans one could ever need, there was also a huge collection of spices available for our use. This was definitely a nice extra; I travel a lot and I always dislike having to buy whole jars or packs of something to use just a tiny bit... a very welcome change!
The car park is closed off and properly secured and I felt more than safe leaving my car there.
Mil is a great guy. There was a minor misunderstanding about our departure time, but it was resolved quickly and without problems by Mil, who was very flexible in the matter.
I will definitely be going back here!",2013,5.0,joy

Judith and Tim made me feel welcome from the first minute, and I felt so homely during my week in their leafy retreat. The room is gorgeous: Beautifully decorated, with a desk facing an adorable park which was just the perfect spot for me to work during the day. I enjoyed Judith & Tim's hospitality, it was great talking to them, drinking a glass of wine together, and getting the best advice & tips about this really great neighbourhood. Clapton is a great area if you are into trendy hipster stuff but hate hipster tourism ;) Awesome cafés, trendy bars, and a cute market on Saturdays.

Edris tries very hard to provide us the food that we like and we did have lots of respect of our privacy and space. TV has lots of programs and works very well, the house was constantly well kept in a high standard and of great location. Catford is a safe and interesting community.

She was very patient and supporting while I was making my first steps in traveling with airbnb - explaining everything as often as I needed it to be explained and keeping in touch from my first request on. Finally arriving in London felt more like visiting a friend than arriving in a foreign city. She was not just welcoming me and letting me in her flat, she also gave me all the knowledge I needed for London to survive - including helping me hunt down my first oyster card. Just for my comfort she moved out of the flat when I arrived to give me privacy but she also offered me to show me a bit around if I'd feel lonely and she was always, even if out of the country, available for me - any time! The flat itself was perfectly situated for my stay and everything I needed just nearby - supermarkets, nice cafés, pubs, shops and the best bus lines, subway and nightlines to go everywhere someone would like to go in London and to my surprise: no street noise at all!

675078,5079387,2013-06-11,3432698,Dorancy,"Paul's apartment was everything that we could have hoped for. It was exactly what we needed for 5 days. The location, though in zone 3 and a bit of a train ride from the center of London, was fantastic. Right by a fabulous little park, my friend and I were able to go running. Be aware that the park is quite tiny and after a few loops, you would be inclined to go running along the road. 

The apartment was very clean and spacious. As we were on vacation, the satellite tv kept us very well entertained with movies when we were at home. The kitchen had all the equipments we needed for making breakfast before we went out.The Pontoon dock station is as described, right next to the apartment, and about less than a five min. walk. 

I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Paul's. Would absolutely recommend his place, as I would stay there again when I am in London. 

I did not have the pleasure to meet with Paul, but our communication, typically through email, was always cordial and friendly. If you are looking for a quiet and beautiful location, Paul's is the place for you.

P.S. The apartment is close to the South (Bank) airport, I believe. And though you'd occasionally hear a plane fly by, you'd barely notice it unless you were outside or had the windows open.

All in all, a delightful stay. Thank you Paul.",2013,5.0,joy

We were 2 mins from restaurants at the Highlands Center (Corner of Hollywood and Highlands).  And in spite of the craziness and noise just right outside the building our place was quiet.  The cost was very competitive for the space - the two futons made perfect beds for my teenagers and a private room for me.  It comes with a parking space which is really nice in this very congested area (traffic was horrible!) The complex was also really nice just by itself - I wished we'd had another day to just chill at the pool and grill out at the poolside patio.  One word of caution be sure you get exact instructions on checking out.  There's a great building security system but it's a little confusing - especially if you use the parking.  I ended up having to mail the security fob back.  Sharon was very helpful, easy to work with and the confusing check out was not her fault.

594777,5599045,2013-07-08,1613682,Kimberly,"We stayed at Teresa's rental over the July 4th long weekend and didn't have any issues finding the place. The directions were clear in the email that she sent to us, including the instructions that she gave us on how to enter the unit when Nassim wasn't able to physically be there to greet us. We were really glad that the place had AC units in both bedrooms upstairs! The sound and comfort of the AC had our 2-year old son knocked out right away in his room. And it was also nice that his room had the sun block-out shade, so it was nice and dark even during the day when he had to take his afternoon nap. <br/><br/>The only thing that I would advise to parents with young kids is that this place might not be the safest for your toddler, but ONLY because the staircase is made of hard concrete. We had to watch our son closely to make sure that he wasn't climbing up or down the stairs. I think we would've felt better if there was a baby gate. But other than that, he enjoyed the toys that were provided by Teresa. <br/><br/>Also, make sure that you bring your toiletries, hair dryer, and extra paper goods like toilet paper, tissue, and paper towels because as Teresa had mentioned in her listing, this place is kept simple. We just made sure to bring some extra goods with us since we had a child with us, and you know how messy kids can get!<br/><br/>And last but not least, this place is definitely in the more urban side of LA. So just play it safe and don't walk around at night by yourself. Although we were intimidated by the neighborhood when we had first arrived, we enjoyed only having to drive 10-15 minutes from the rental to go meet up with our friends in Pasadena, Alhambra, Downtown LA, and Monterey Park. We loved the fact that we could visit all the good eats within a short distance!e<br/><br/>We did come across an issue with the bath tub being clogged, but it was later fixed by a plumber who came by after we notified Teresa and Nassim. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this place is a great find for the price you pay.

The communal area - living room, eating area and kitchen - were more than ample.  Having a washer-driver was an added bonus.  And it was very convenient to transportation and to many good moderately-priced restaurants and cafes.

He accommodated for an early check-in since our flight was in earlier than the listed check-in town.  The bungalow was very cute and clean. It was nicer inside than even the pictures represented. There were fresh towels and guides to the area. We even took advantage of a few of the DVD's as we were falling asleep at night. The location was perfect, only one block away from the beach and pier. My husband and I enjoy the beach but also enjoy having alternative things to do. We were able to take advantage of the pier activities including paddle boats, farmers market, live music, and of lots of food and drink places. The only notable disadvantage was that there wasn't any air conditioning. This did not affect us because it was fairly cool when we were there, but if you plan to stay inside or do not handle heat well, you may want to be aware. However, there is a front and back door that can be opened to have good air flow and I can't imagine it being too hot at night being so close to the water. ",2013,5.0,joy

But that being said I want to get to point is that there we were both bitten up terribly by fleas that were in the bed. I got bit over 60 (I counted) times and my friend got bit at least 20 times during our stay. At first, Michaela assured us that it couldn't have been from her place. But when we woke up on the second night with more bites we lifted up the covers and there were all these little black spots and tiny larva at the foot of the bed. I suspect that Foxy (the cat) must have spread them about, as she is an indoor-outdoor cat. Suffice to say I am now horribly itchy and painfully uncomfortable with my legs covered in bites.<br/><br/>Michaela gave us a refund of 1 night but at this point I'm not too sure if that was worth it, considering that we only spent two nights there and got eaten alive by fleas for it. <br/><br/>I will probably not be returning to this house, mostly due to the fact that I just don't want to risk staying in a place with a pet that could spread fleas.

There are three nice restaurants/bars opposite (you should definitely try the corgette flower pizza from Lardo) - and a supermarket within 5 mins walk so a perfect location but once in the flat you don't hear anything.

The flat is on the 3rd floor with no lift so if you have any issue with exercise it might be a problem but for us it was fine. The stairs are only short so really not as bad as it sounds and gave us a bit of exercise!

The rooms and all the amenities are very clean, new, well-decorated and tasteful and the hostess takes care of everything to the slightest detail. The building is right behind the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Bvd, there are several bars and restaurants and every Hollywood attraction is a 5 to 15 minute walk from the building. There is also a Trader Joes and several Walgreens one block away.<br/>Two minor problems: the first one is that there are two shared bathrooms on each floor and in the morning they were almost always occupied by people taking showers and we couldn't use the WC when we needed to. It would have been better if the showers and the WC were two separate rooms.  But they were both impeccably clean so the ""bathroom traffic"" is a minor problem for me . The other problem is the noise; not coming from bars as other guests said, but from a parking lot next to the building and from the airconditioning, which is old and makes a lot of noise.  But hey, it is always noisy in LA and especially in  Hollywood and noise is very difficult to avoid in places as big and vibrant as this. Plus, the noise did not prevent us from sleeping anyway. Mary was very kind and thoughtful and gave us earplugs so this problem was sorted out. She also allowed us to leave our luggage inside the building after checking-out so that we could enjoy a few more hours of sightseeing before leaving LA. All in all, my experience was very positive and I am aware of the fact that places as clean and as decent are hard to find in LA. You should definitely give it a try!!!",2013,5.0,joy

Second reason was to be near the Hollywood Sign and, I tought, near Santa Monica… No! It is more than 1h to get to Santa Monica by car (by Beverly Hills). Everything is far in L.A. so have a car.<br/><br/>The Hollywood Sign is really near, walk up on Deronda Drive 1 minute and you’ll see this big sign!<br/><br/>We stayed 2 nights. We were late and we couldn’t warn Robert. He was comprehensive and we could check-in easily. The studio has a beautiful look but was not very clean (dust on coffee table, on the top of the refrigerator, on the bedside table…) and need some little renovation (tiles were broken in the bathroom, the shower was yellowed, the wardrobe’s door was broken), the only cooking utensil was a wooden spoon : not helpful to flip a steak! The cutting board and the pan were very used : it’s not hygienic. The garbage was smaller. On the bed, the comforter set was dirty (spotted).<br/><br/>We had only 1 towel by person, we would have liked a beach towel and a parasol. A lot of old cosmetic in the shower : I don’t think it’s professional. <br/><br/>So the stay was passable but the price was low (106$ per night) and there is an amazing view…<br/><br/>And must be very careful to drive in the hills!",2013,5.0,joy

The neighborhood has a lot of culture and we were lucky to stumble upon an African Market in the square one weekend morning. There's some lovely eateries, markets and coffee places nearby. All the buses we needed to visit landmarks like St. Paul's, Abbey Road and the Tate were less that a block away. The bed is perfectly soft and there is plenty of closet space for luggage and clothes.

174132,7483001,2013-09-22,7856095,Robert,"Staying at Erika's was quite an experience. There was a Bed but no Breakfast, we were informed. Breakfast was at Toasts Cafe two blocks away towards the tube. The bedroom was in the basement and appeared to be decorated by blind children who cluttered the walls with knick-knacks, jumble sale items and assorted cast-off books. The furniture was quite faded, chipped and dented. There was a TV and a tray with a hot water maker for our tea. The view from the room was the dirty tool cabinet where we found the keys in the dark the previous night. It was just good fortune I brought a flashlight to trundle down the unlighted steps at 9:30 PM. Erika was not there to greet us. Three days before we were to arrive I got an email saying where she'd leave the keys...all this knowing we were to be late arrivals and on our first time to England.The room was clean enough and we had no complaints there, but we really thought that B&B meant just that. She also insisted that shoes were to be left upstairs and we complied. The first morning we saw why. The sidewalk was spotty with plenty of dog-merds left by uncaring dog lovers.
Her photos of her place are far from accurate. The photos of the building were taken from the communal area and not a street view of the bleak doorway that was far from welcoming. All in all, it was probably one of the more bizarre places we've stayed in 20 years and well worth sharing with our friends back home.  ",2013,3.0,sadness

Die Wohnung liegt außerhalb von London. Man benötigt schon ca. 50 Minuten um ins Zentrum zu gelangen. Züge fahren ca. alle halbe Stunde. Wir haben die Wohnung mit 5 Personen gemietet und sind davon ausgegangen, dass die 3 Sofas zum Schlafen geeignet sind. Leider war der Schlafkomfort nicht so gut und wenn man mit mehreren Personen fährt, sollte man sich darauf einstellen, sehr weich zu schlafen und entsprechende Decken oder Schlafsäcke mitnehmen. Angenehmer ist es sicherlich, wenn man die Wohnung mit weniger Personen mietet. Küche und Badezimmer wirken wie vor einer Renovierung. Die Ausstattung in der Küche ist gewöhnungsbedürftig. Es sind viele Dinge da, jedoch nicht alle in einem guten Zustand. So haben wir uns z.B. einen neuen Kochtopf gekauft.

If you prefer the bus you can also take the bus number 25 in Mile End road very near to the flat, and then you can change bus in Bank station and catch the bus number 23.
The buses are very frequent in London, every 5 minutes or less.
I suggest to go around by bus because you can see the town in the meantime. 
There is also a Barclays Bicycle Hire where you can rent a bike for few pounds near the underground station in Stepney Green. 
If you need to buy something to eat I suggest to go to Tesco Market just outside Stepney Green Rd that is very cheap, 
or you can find 2 mini market in MIle End Rd, 24 hours opened.
Cahir will help you in everything you need. He's very helpful and he is very quick to answer to your questions.",2013,4.0,joy

When we came across this beautiful urban farm we decided to try it out - and are so very glad that we did.<br/><br/>I can't express enough how much we enjoyed our stay here. To start off with, the location is perfect - just a few streets away from Melrose, so you can easily walk out in the morning to get breakfast or lunch from one of the many nearby great cafes and coffee shops. Parking on the street was never a problem either, which was a pleasant surprise in such a popular area.<br/>Each morning we would wake up to such peace and tranquility - even though so close to Melrose, the farm is extremely quiet and relaxing. Our hosts, Cindy & Anthony, are two of the warmest, friendliest people we could hope to be staying with. We felt instantly at home, as if we were staying with friends. We loved to stop and chat about the animals, and they were very helpful with suggestions on good hikes, nice places to eat etc. In saying that, they thoroughly respected our privacy and the place felt just like our own little apartment.<br/><br/>We actually made two separate trips there, so we stayed in both the upstairs and downstairs apartments - we found both to be very cosy and homely. We did like the upstairs apartment a little more as there was a big balcony which we liked to sit and have breakfast or coffee, looking out over the animals.<br/>If you are an animal lover, you will love to meet the adorable and colourful characters at the farm! We fell in love with all the animals straight away, and missed them greatly when we left.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the next time we visit Los Angeles, we will be staying at this wonderful place again. We can't recommend it enough!!",2013,5.0,joy

That distance became even more evident when, once on the property, Murray drove us along with our dog and bags in a terrain appropriate vehicle to our final destination. First and foremost, the location is spectacular – comparable to pulling off at a view point on a beautiful highway to admire the 360 views. One could say that is exactly what to expect – minus the noisy traffic, and you get back in the Airstream not the car, and you don’t have to drive away. Relax and enjoy the sunset that darkens to a starry night and wake up to sounds of nature all around from an exceptionally comfortable bed. Pretty sweet. Murray and Kay were considerate and accommodating hosts and we enjoyed finding common interests over an impromptu gathering. The trailer is very cozy and stocked with everything one needs. Only thing to note is that the bathroom is bit awkward for taller folks. We came with enough food that had we not wanted to get back in the car during our visit, we wouldn’t have to. Hiking trails are accessible directly from the property and there is plenty of space to roam and explore. Great experience. Highly recommend it. ",2013,4.0,joy

Luckily for us, Leigh and Stephanie's place was still available for those 3 days. They told us later they are usually booked solid for several month out, we just got lucky. Their pictures looked great but who knows how something will turn out when you actually see it. The pictures were very accurate. Their place was very clean, very comfortable and perfect place to stay. The living room is huge. The bedrooms are both clean and comfortable. I loved the little deck out back and they provided a parking space in the gated driveway. This was such a fun house to stay in. The kitchen is large and was so nice to have. I never met Stephanie but Leigh (and his dogs) was very personable and friendly. I texted him during our drive to let him know we'd get in late and when we arrived we found a bottle of wine on the counter to help us de-stress after such a long trip. If you need a clean, liveable place to stay in Venice Beach area and if you are clean and respectful yourselves then this is the place. It would be a great house for a small family as well. The house is about a 15 min walk to the beach and about a 5-10 min walk to a very nice Whole Foods grocery store. Leigh also guided us to a very busy, very nice street (Abbott something) that was near the beach as well with lots of shops and restaurants. This place was more than we could have hoped for and a great price at $150 per night. I am extremely happy with this place and would absolutely stay again. ",2013,4.0,joy

My stay in Harrow at Marcus's place was quite good: The room has a private shower, a desk, chest of drawers and a refrigerator. This is an excellent place if you are looking for peace and quiet.

Marcus was an amiable and pleasant host - and went out of his way to make sure I knew how to get to places. He is quick to repond to messages and knows a thing or two about English ales.

We are Canadian, and though I lived in London during uni, my sister had not yet been, so I wanted to stay in an area that would give her a really good glimpse into what its like to be a local Londoner. Queens Park was the perfect location for us - it is quiet and cute, with lots of good local spots to eat and drink and its conveniently located on the Bakerloo line, which takes you quickly to the very centre of London. After a busy day out in the city crowds, it was heavenly to come back to Queens Park and mellow out on that incredible roof top patio, or down in the back garden. Three bathrooms made it very easy for 4 girls to get ready, and Anthony made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay - he even drew us maps and gave us take out menus to his favourite local spots. I would seriously consider staying here again on my next visit to this amazing city.

761630,3727414,2013-03-09,4591594,Alice,"I stayed here with my family for 9 days and we absolutely loved the fact that it felt like a cosy home away from home!  We had 4 people stay which was perfect as there is ample space for everyone.  Whether you wanted to sit and read on the couch, watch tv or just lay in bed in between the day activities - the place was great!  There's a cosy garden area as well which includes a seating area so if the weather is good you can bring a book out and enjoy the sunshine or watch the squirrels play from the living room window.  Everything you need is provided for - from the bathroom amenities (a bath set was a truly great touch after a lot of driving and travel!) to the kitchen ware and also laundry detergent.  The area is safe and the neighbors are friendly.  There is a running/cycling route just down the street which we made use of during our stay there.  We loved that the area is away from the hectic city vibe and yet still conveniently located from all the main spots one would want to visit in LA.  It's about 20-30 minutes drive to LACMA/Downtown LA.  It was about 10-15 minutes drive to Santa Monica.  There's also downtown Culver City which has a great offering of food outlets, eateries, bars, Trader Joe's, cinema, etc.  The two managers who were there to receive us and make sure everything was okay were simply the best!  During our stay we needed an extra key and they were able to make an extra copy in less than 30 minutes so that our schedule didn't need to be re-worked.  We also needed a hair-dryer and a brand new one appeared the very next day.  They were extremely hospitable and we enjoyed greeting them every morning on our way out from our place.<br/><br/>Just some suggestions for future: <br/>- 1 of the bathrooms might do well to have an added door as when you're staying with friends or an extended family member it's a little awkward having to ask the other party to leave the room as you use the shower<br/><br/>- 1 of the beds squeaked throughout the night so 2 members of the family weren't as well rested as we were in the morning.  <br/><br/>- The laundry door could also have a door added as it was a little noisy when we wanted to watch what was on the tv without the volume being too loud.<br/><br/>- Something about the material of the floorboards that just kept picking up dust around the house.  Not sure what can be done here but perhaps a quick fix of coating the floorboards with something.<br/><br/>- The dining room chairs are a little too cramped making it challenging for people to pass through to the laundry or kitchen when people are seated.  A few minor trip ups so perhaps a change in the chairs or table could do the trick.",2013,5.0,joy

145612,5791431,2013-07-16,2135849,Julia,"Nina's place is great, the bus to the subway stops right in front of her apartment, and comes very often. We took bus E8 to the Ealing broadway, about 10 minutes to reach underground, district and central line. The room is very nice, there is everything you need, the bed is comfy. I recommend Nina's place because it is a nice place. The only thing that upset me was a confrontation that I had with Nina about the house rules. Nina was telling me that I didn't do something right, and she wants the guests to follow her rules, in my opinion those were minor little things, that I didn't pay so much attention to. But that's her house, and she wants things to stay nice and  work properly, that's understandable. I also didn't understand why NIna didn't want to let me use the iron , she said we don't  iron things in this country, anyway I asked her brother and he let me use it. I also don't appreciate when someone tells me what to wear, I felt like Nina is my mom, and I had to listen to her. Those are some minor personality issues, however, it made me question my airbnb experiences. It is inexpensive, very nice room, very nice people, her daughter and her brother are very good. Nina herself, is very interesting too, she allowed me to stay in her place with the child and didn't charge extra. My daughter just loved Nina, and asked about her every day. When I told Nina that I would like to keep my privacy and distance she totally understood. Nina's family wants to treat you like their family, maybe it's just me that I like to have a hotel type experience, I just can't afford hotels. 

Nina is a generous woman, her family is wonderful, and the place is very nice, conveniently located, and I would definitely reccommnd it to my friends over all other places, and even though I had a confrontation in the beginning, I would still come back to Nina. ",2013,4.0,anger

This was the first time in LA / Venice and first time using Airbnb so we did not know exactly what to expect which may explain some of my comments.<br/>The location of the appartment is really great as described by previous guests. It is only 25 m from the Venice boardwalk and the view of the beach from the appartment is all we had hoped for. Also. it was very close to the main resturant and shopping streets Abott Kinney, Rose and Main. The downside of this location is that it attracts people that can be very noisy, especially at night, and some of these people can be a bit intimidating. The appartment in itself is spacious and flooded with light. On the negative side I felt it was more worn down than I had expected from the pictures. Some of the lights did not work were not replaced despite a request regarding this. We only used the kitchen for breakfasts but my impression was that it was fully equiped.  Everything worked smoothly in accessing the appartment and a big plus for the parking space just next to the appartment.  Overall a memorable, positive stay in Venice.",2014,4.0,joy

It's a 20 minute walk to the nearest tube station (Ladbroke Gve); from here it's easy to get to Portobello and its Saturday market and also to the Notting Hill area.

The location is excellent, there is a bus stop in front of the house and a 10 minute walk to the subway (stockwell).

It was exactly like the photos online, so the listing is very accurate. The entire apartment is so quiet - I rarely heard any neighbors or the guests who were staying in the downstairs space - and the loft is such a great, cozy space that I felt right at home. David was a great host, too!  He was there to welcome me when I arrived, and he responded immediately when I had any questions during my stay. Through no fault of his own, the internet went out on my first day there. He was very quick to troubleshoot the situation and, when we found that it was an issue with Virgin Wireless in the entire area, he provided me with access to a BT hotspot until the problem was fixed (which it was that same evening).  I look forward to coming back to London in the future, and I will definitely be booking again with David! ",2014,5.0,joy

He was very prompt in meeting up with us and was always quick to respond to our emails and texts. When we experienced a few minor plumbing issues, Tim went above and beyond to ensure they were fixed.  Tim has a great demeanor and was a very welcoming host to us.  

Tim's flat is located in a wonderfully central location.  Its close proximity to the Marble Arch tube station and Hyde Park was a real plus.  The flat is located in an area known as Little Lebanon but, as two people who have traveled widely around the globe, we had with the neighborhood and always felt very comfortable. There are plenty of shopping choices nearby including two large grocery stores within a block.  

For a studio, the flat felt spacious and Tim furnished it very nicely.  It had all the right things.  We especially liked the two large wardrobes and the washing machine.  It also offered great natural light each morning!  It exceeded our expectations across the board and we really enjoyed our stay at Tim's flat.

The Northern Line drives you to the best spots in  London (Camden Town, Leicester Square etc ...) so it will make your londonian experience way easier.

It's in a very safe location and a 5 minute walk from the beach and a beach dog park. It's also a quick walk to 2nd street which is lined with shops and tons of restaurants. Would have loved to stay here longer and enjoy the location a bit more.,2014,4.0,joy

1381369,13183523,2014-05-21,13928631,Stephen,"It was a fantastic experience. We stayed for a week.  We had between 3 and 9 adults stay overnight with a party one night for 40-50 adults.  Everyone, including the party folks were extremely impressed with the house.  We could not have selected a better place.<br/>All the rooms are extremely unique and the views of downtown LA and the neighborhood were spectacular.  Because the house is so unique, we did not have to do any decorations for the party.<br/>The host was most helpful and accommodating.  The host stayed in the attic.  If you did not want any contact, the host would basically be invisible.  However, in our opinion, that would be a mistake.  Al and Leslie are wonderful people with lots of marvelous stories and they are excellent musicians.  When you come into the house the first thing you notice is the double bass.  We invited them to the party.  They were the hit.  We even had an informal jam session very late in the evening.<br/>By the way, there were no problems with the neighbors.<br/>If you like to walk, the neighborhood and the homes are interesting.  Silver Lake is close by and Sunset Blvd. has all types of eating establishments.  <br/>Finally, we would just like to emphasize that we really enjoyed our stay.<br/>Stephen, Mirta and Mohja Rhoads",2014,5.0,surprise

They were readily available throughout my stay if I had any questions to ask, and made me quite at ease with doing so.<br/>I loved staying in this cottage even if they were probably the wettest days i've ever experienced in Los Angeles.

2526345,17672558,2014-08-16,13965218,Stephen David,"My roommate and I stayed in Patricia's guest house for three months so we became very familiar with the property over the course of our summer stay in LA. <br/>The guest house itself is built onto the garage. There's actually a locked door in the bedroom that leads straight into the garage. Thankfully they never parked their cars in the garage while we were there, which probably would have been a deal breaker because of the whole carbon monoxide thing. The bed was as comfy as I could've asked for, no complaints whatsoever there. There is a window in the ceiling that's pretty much impossible to cover up and magnifies the sun right onto the bed in the morning and illuminates the whole room by 8AM so don't plan on sleeping in too much <br/>The kitchenette is very small, but did the job relatively well (beware of the oven, it will heat up the entire place about 10-15 degrees when in use). <br/>Thankfully Patricia had an AC unit installed during our stay which made our stay much more comfortable. <br/>The single sleeper couch was a bit stained and had some pet hair on it. As a college student who has spent the last three years with grungy furniture it wasn't a problem, but it was incredibly stiff and not very comfortable for tv watching, but you're in LA so there's not much need for it anyway. It's described as being able to sleep a visiting guest on it, but when we pulled it out we discovered that it would only be able to accommodate a small child. <br/>As for Patricia and her family, you can't really ask for nicer hosts! Her husband and two sons were accommodating and friendly whenever we needed their help with something. It's worth noting that the boys sometimes play loud music at odd hours but they're always happy to turn down their jams for you. <br/>Also be aware that they do have two dogs that are usually roaming around outside. They are super friendly dogs, I would've taken them home with me if I could have! Just don't leave shoes or clothes outside because they are known to claim them as their own. <br/>Overall I had an absolutely wonderful summer at this guest house and would be happy to come back some day!

1218877,14290717,2014-06-16,4187787,Stephen,"Julia's place was great!  It looks almost exactly as the photos suggest, though the desk and the refrigerator are actually on opposite sides of the room, and the latter is in fact larger in real life (and includes a freezer).  Most of my time was spent out and about doing a myriad tourist activities, so the majority of my time in the room was spent on the bed, which is pretty comfortable, especially if you like a soft mattress.  

Apart from that, everything really is exactly as described -- just outside the room is a kitchenette stocked with all the necessary utensils for a quick meal (which I didn't make use of) as well as a laundry machine (that also dries, albeit slowly).  The main bathroom -- i.e., toilet and shower -- are shared with others that Julia also rents out via airbnb or other means; it's a rather quiet and friendly living area.

Location-wise, I think being right around the corner from the Shepherd's Bush Market Tube stop as well as a 5-7min walk to the Shepherd's Bush Tube station is perfect, as it makes London really accessible (and a lot more affordable than other options!).  A few days before my arrival, Julia e-mailed me directions to her place, and they were very easy to follow.

I told Julia that my flight would arrive early in the morning, and she graciously let me show up a bit earlier than the standard 2pm check-in time, which I really appreciated!

Pablo was who we met (Carolina was in Mexico) and he was very accommodating and helpful. He even took us on a little walk around the area and showed us where the market and the tube was plus recommended to us some good food. He definitely went above and beyond the call of duty to help the check in process to be an A+ experience. Carolina also emailed us a couple weeks before with a house manual with user instructions. They are both very very organized. 

The pros of the house are that it's big and it's only a 5 minute walk to the underground station plus 2 supermarkets. There is a nice kitchen that we didn't cook with, but it's still nice to have. There is also a washer AND dryer, which most places don't have. The dryer though takes a long time to dry even with small baby clothes, so we would usually run one cycle and hang dry it around the house (even when the lint filter is cleaned). The bathrooms are very nice and the design is very modern.

The cons are that for our situation with 2 babies, it wasn't the most child friendly house, but that isn't the hosts faults. There were just a lot of things that were breakable. :) There were some things that also didn't work and one of the queen beds fell off the wooden board holding it twice while we were sleeping on it with our 8 month old baby. We were ok and managed to insert something to hold the bed in place. Plus the shower pressure wasn't working well in our room after the first day and the bathroom heater didn't work. The kitchen sink drain is tricky too. We didn't cook at all, but it still clogged. My dad is a handyman around the house and managed to fix it.

I also would call this place more a 2 bedroom plus an attic. Unfortunately, the ceilings on the top floor are fairly low, so my sister/bro in law hit their heads a few times in the beginning (5'6"" and 5'9"").

The last thing to note is that there aren't very many good restaurants around to choose from, so you pretty much have to take the train somewhere if you don't want to eat the same chains located nearby.

Pablo checked on us often, supplied us with coffee and was very very hospitable. He was kind and definitely did his best to make our experience a great one. He offered to fix anything, but we declined and it didn't change our experience. It was still a positive and  good time.

With all that said, I would still recommend Carolina and Pablo. :)

I agree with one of the other reviewers - room should have been listed as ""private room"" and not ""entire home/flat"" due to the shared bathroom - we totally missed the part about sharing a bathroom until we'd accepted the trip - this detail is somewhat buried in the description and these days one expects a whole apartment to have its own bathroom. 

House is divided into 18 bedsits/flats. Shared bathroom not as clean as it could have been, as a result did not feel comfortable using shower. In the room, mainly well cleaned but the vent in the kitchen area was absolutely filthy.

The closet space was perfect since it allowed us to hang all the clothing we brought with us on our week long trip. To anyone staying a few days - it's going to be common for you to eat out at restaurants and you'll be looking to store your leftovers/doggybag somewhere when you get home, so make sure you buy ice (and possibly a plastic bag) as your only option is in the cooler that's provided with the suite. <br/><br/>Christian and Meredith were communicative with us and were there when we needed to borrow items.<br/><br/>As for Echo Park, we adventured through the surrounding area by foot and found some other cool spots and architecture tucked away in the neighbourhood.

It was nice experience - going up and down the stairs (like in Sherlock Holmes museum), to look through a window into a yard and trees on a street.
I pleased for Loredana's hospitality. Her flat is wonderful. There is everything you need for cooking, sleeping and well-being. A mattress on a bed is the same as we have got at home (I slept very well). We used Royal Oak the tube station for traveling in London (it's only 7 minutes walking distance), also we used direct buses to arrive at Holland Park. We went to Kensington Gardens in 15-20 minutes. There are 2 supermarkets nearby (Sainsbury's Local and Waitrose).
I definitely recommend Loredana's flat for staying (even though I think about visiting London again and staying at Loredana's flat again too).",2014,5.0,joy

Countless good restaurants and takeaways conveniently couple of minutes walk away. There is a small corner shop just opposite the apartment to satisfy any cravings.

Amazing Host! - Aaron provided us with a very detailed infokit upon confirmation of reservation that demonstrated his thoroughness and professionalism in ensuring we had a smooth checking-in and stay at the flat. He was readily contactable and his workplace is just downstairs!

Overall, one of the key reason why our London was so enjoyable was because of this apartment. We saved so much compared to staying in hotels.

Thank you so much for being such great hosts for our visit in London!

The room was very pleasant, located in a comfortable location (short walk from the underground and near the city centre) at a reasonable price.

apartment was in great condition with full equipment for staying, including coffee capsules and tea, and sugar - just boil the water! :)
the only bad thing to say - the toilet flushing cistern - it takes almost half an hour to fill it. :( but we maneged the situation...
so, next time when we're going to London - first thing searching place to stay - ClubLiving... maybe we'll try another part of London, as I see ClubLiving got it!

She rescued us after we'd booked a terrible place and were stranded in LA and staying in a hotel. Our first night, she sat with us while we searched for a place to live, ate dinner with us, and encouraged us. She showed us around town, took us to the farmer's market, invited us to club meetings, connected us with people. We ended up staying for 4 days, but would have stayed longer if not for having our baby with us (we needed more space). Not only will you get full value for your dollar when it comes to the condition, cleanliness, beauty of the house(which is nothing short of spectacular), neighborhood and location, you will get to know a uniquely warm, welcoming and outgoing individual who addresses everyone's problems like they are her own. At the same time, Rita gives you as much privacy as you would like.<br/>Immaculately clean house. Gorgeous and friendly neighborhood. Accessible location.

I always looked forward to coming back to Linda's place at the end of a long day and climbing in the super comfy bed. Waking up in the morning was a true delight, I loved all the sunlight streaming in and my boyfriend really loved his morning reading on the sofa in the adjoining living area.

Nice having access to a kitchen, well-supplied with basics. Short walk (under 5 min) to Kentish Town tube/train/buses, with nice shops, restaurants & pubs in the vicinity and a village-like feel to it.
The only drawback was that we found the 10.5 tog duvet too warm and would have preferred to have available as an alternative a couple of blankets (the night temperatures varied a lot during our stay) but the bed itself was very comfortable.",2014,4.0,love

John and Magda were extremely prompt and accommodating in all their communications leading up to and during our stay.  We arrived quite early on check-in day and were able to store our luggage in a safe and secure spot across the street until the previous guests had departed and the flat had been cleaned.  The flat is very conveniently located with easy access to the Earl's Court and Gloucester Road Tube Stations which provide you access or connections to anywhere you need to travel.  A Sainburys supermarket is literally a 2 minute walk away, Waitrose 6 minutes away, Tesco 15 minutes away and Whole Foods Kensington is just a 15 minute walk.  Kensington Gardens is also just a 15 minute walk.  The most economical form of transportation to and from Heathrow Airport, the Tube, is also just 45 minutes away via the Piccadilly line.

The flat is well furnished with modern appliances and furniture and the kitchen was a pleasure to cook in.  We especially enjoyed the full size refrigerator and freezer, oven, and induction cooktop stove.  You will also find plenty of dinnerware and cookware to prepare most any meal you would like.  An assortment of cooking and cleaning supplies have also been provided to make your stay a little easier.

Just like the kitchen, the bathrooms are quite modern and include a number of nice touches.  Having 2 bathrooms was a nice convenience not always found in UK/European accommodations.

The living room was quite comfortable and provided us a nice place to relax and unwind after long days exploring the city.  Flat screen TVs are found in both the living room and the bedroom.  The heating in both the living room and bedroom is quite responsive and will keep you plenty warm if you stay during the cooler months as we did.  The bed is comfortable and allowed us to sleep well each night.

The location felt very safe and we appreciated the motion sensor light above the entryway.  There are approximately 10 steps leading down to this garden level flat.  The area was also fairly quiet and we did not experience any more noise than would be typical in any large metropolitan city like London.

Overall, we were extremely pleased with the flat and our experience working with the hosts.  The process was extremely easy and we had a great stay.  We felt that the accommodations provided good value for our money and the location was a great base for exploring London and beyond.",2014,5.0,joy

It feels like you're the first person to ever have stayed there, because it's so darn clean. Cleaner than a hotel room. and not in that overly-fragrant, freshly mopped kind if way- but in a breezy, amazingly spotless and seemingly effortless kind of way. 2. I feel like I could live here full time, too. 3. The driveway is narrow, but to have a parking spot off the street at all is so nice, so we didn't mind. So many other things! Lovely patio, nice bed, comfy linens and towels, very private, Janet was easy going and quick to respond to any questions, super close to food and coffee, good internet.

We got in late due to the metro strikes in London and both Steve and Nicola were extremely caring and accomodating to our situation and waited up very late  to help us find our way to the flat and get situated in our room. 

The room itself is very clean and modern with a comfortable bed, a TV with a USB port (for charging extra devices :]), a full length mirror, a dresser and a desk. There is a hairdryer available for the ladies as well. The bathroom is a shared bathroom but is modern and kept very clean and we never had any problems accessing it when we needed too. There are multiple bathrooms so even if it had been in use, we others to use. There was a kitchen for use that was very modern and equipped, but we didn't use it since we were only there for a few days. There is also a very lovely rooftop terrace with a picnic table overlooking nearby flats. It was a great place to sit and relax after a long day!

The location is excellent! 3 minutes to the Aldgate station and 5 minutes to the Liverpool station. There are tons of restaurants nearby (we loved a little cafe called Simply Tasty Cafe which was very welcoming and delicious) and it is a really hip young area of town. We felt very safe in this neighborhood, even in the middle of the night. If you were used to a place like NYC or Rome, you could walk to some of the main sites no problem.

We, a party of four consisting of me, my wife, and my parents from Japan, all had a wonderful and pleasant time with total relaxation spending 5 days there in August. The place got everything we imagined in ideal Airbnb experience, which we could not have by staying hotels. <br/><br/>It is situated in very nice and quiet residential area, but is also closed to freeway, so has easy access to anywhere around LA areas by car. There are a beautiful park within walking distance and grocery stores including Trader Joe's pretty close by car. There are also some interesting sightseeing spots in local area and Osiris was so nice to take us a little tour looking around them one night.<br/>The house is so clean and cozy, and you find everything you need with absolute no inconvenience. No wonder it's perfect because the owner actually lives there (as the introduction says, the owner vacates when the house is rented by guests). Parking space in the premises is a little too narrow for mid-size SUV, but there are plenty of street parking space around the house. Rooms are all very spacious and nicely decorated with cute antique items, which fascinated my mother so much. The kitchen is huge and fully equipped so we had no trouble cooking for breakfast and dinner. The gorgeous living room has a beautiful antique piano which my father enjoyed playing. It was a nice surprise that 2 bathrooms has toilets installed with bidets. The place has a nice back patio surrounded by fruit trees where we can sit and enjoy meals and BBQ. Osiris let us to take figs from the tree whenever we want and they were sooo good.<br/><br/>Finally, Osiris is not only a wonderful person who is friendly, attentive, and responsive to any questions, but also is a well-experienced host who have accepted many guests all over the world before. Osiris could minimized a contact with us to respect our privacy while could be a great company to talk to with upon request. We invited Osiris to a dinner one night and enjoyed wine together talking about many things and sharing the experiences. <br/>We definitely choose Osiris' place in case of coming back to LA and absolutely recommend it to those who wants the same experience.

The building itself is not the prettiest (but by no means is it bad), but the actual flat is perfectly home-y. The kitchen and fridge are big, and the bathroom is full size.

I had some trouble obtaining my key from the grocer. They just kept telling me that they didn't have it without even looking to see if they did or not.

Once we found the place, a challenging task for two jet lagged travelers, we were immediately impressed. Steve gave us the grand tour and asked about our trip. Immediately, he was offering advice for navigating the local area. In our short week there, he accommodated every minor request or need we had, even supplying us with an outlet adapter and a blow dryer for my wife. As a host, he went above and beyond by providing us with daily refills of milk and butter to go with the raspberry jam and bread he provided for toast. We enjoyed many early mornings out on the rooftop with our toast, jam, and coffee planning the day's events, which also would not have been possible without the free wifi.

Traveling abroad can be as scary as it is exhilarating. These guys took away all the scary and made our trip as fun and comfortable as possible.

Oh, I should also mention that the area was quite cool. The market just outside seemed to always be setting up or tearing down, but that meant there was always plenty of energy. We were only about a two minute walk from the Aldgate East tube station and a bunch of stores, coffee shops, and things like that. A bit further are Aldgate and Liverpool stations. A bit closer are a few pubs and a whole long stretch of famed London Indian restaurants, which made for a good carry out meal one tired evening.

I can't recommend this lodging and this host enough. The price is great, location is convenient, and the accommodations are just what a young couple needed for a great trip. Cheers, Steve!",2014,5.0,surprise

621233,20011254,2014-09-22,8146008,Alice And Simon,"First, my husband are I are faithful Airbnb uses and have never had a problem like this. Secondly, I usually write reviews when I'm a fan of a business and want to support them. That is not this case with this review, which is unfortunately negative in my attempt to be thorough for other Airbnb users. We were very unhappy with the Mermaid Suite and did not stay there for reasons listed below. After I initiated an attempt to get a refund from David through the Airbnb resolution center (intended for situations like us), he responded, but outside of the resolution center, and said he would refund me. He just asked that I cancel the reservation and then he'd send a refund (red flag). I wondered how he would process the refund without the reservation in the system. Deciding to trust him, I tried but was unable to cancel the reservation. Airbnb support informed me that it was impossible to cancel a past reservation. They could see my correspondence with David and saw that he had said he would refund me. Airbnb support said that all I needed to do was to formally request the refund through the resolution center, which was a process I had already begun. Easy. It's been almost two weeks, and David has not processed the refund and takes days to respond to me. He did write me at one point asking, ""Have you left a review? Obviously I would hope that if I give you a refund that you will refrain from writing a review."" I had not written a review and told him I wouldn't. Bottom line: he is stretching this resolution center process out as long as he can. Once the 14-day review period is over, he will deny the refund. At that point, I would have been unable to write a review and warn Airbnbers of his poor business practices. Our issues: - ""Unconventional and rustic"" are very vague and generic terms that do not accurately describe the poor state of this property and we feel were used in an attempt to conceal. - ""Luxurious form of camping"" - We failed to see how this was either luxurious or camping. The use of these words appear to be another attempt to mislead airbnb users. Additional issues: - Stains on sheets and pillowcases, appeared unwashed - Many hairs on both beds - Bugs all over ""apartment,"" on floors walls and tables: silverfish, ants, etc. - Filthy carpets in the main room, on the staircase, upstairs - Safety concerns with inadequate locks and unscreened windows, which were especially concerning due to the people drinking outside - Privacy concerns due to ramshackle construction of the property as a whole - Commune-type feel to property, which was not stated in the description - The fans we asked for and you promised to provide were not there - We were not told the bathroom had a hole in the ceiling and was essentially outdoors, exposed to the...",2014,2.0,love

We were on a family vacation in the LA area, having traveled across the Pacific ocean. <br/><br/>At first Eric seemed like a pleasant host, trying to make his guests feel comfortable. We appreciated his hospitality.<br/><br/>However, we were told in the middle of our stay that he was unable to fulfill the reservation for the entire period, because the room, he realized, had been double booked. Although we were already staying there, the other guest, he claimed, reserved the room before us. He also mentioned that the other guest had reserved three of his rooms, which was a better explanation as to why we were the one that had to leave. I don't know if he realizes what a stressful situation that is. We were in a foreign country on a family vacation with our little girl, this was the day before Christmas Eve, and we had to find a room to stay during Christmas holidays.  Although I could have insisted on staying, I didn't want to create an unpleasant situation for my family.  So we decided to leave.  <br/><br/>Although it was solely because Eric had made a mistake that we were placed in such a stressful situation, he did not try to compensate for the inconvenience.  Instead, he overcharged us. Although I laid out my case he would not listen. I was made feel as if I was the one that was making an unreasonable request. I was very disappointed. I just paid him whatever he asked and left. Later that day he messaged me, saying that he realized he had overcharged me, and that I should come and get the partial refund. By then I was done with wasting my family's vacation time. <br/><br/>It was a very disappointing experience for my family, to say the least. I don't know how one can compensate for time lost during a family vacation, let alone the stress and financial loss. I hope that no other guests will go through the same experience we did.

The bedroom is a little bit smaller than it appears in the photos, but is certainly a comfortable size for someone traveling alone or a couple (without too many bags!).

Imogen offered polite, interesting and intellectual conversation and was very easy to talk with. 

The location is very appealing also. Kings Cross has undergone a gentrification of sorts in the last few years (as I have deduced from speaking with Imogen and the locals) and this, coupled with its accessibility to surrounding areas of interest by foot (along the canals to Camden) and the London Underground (anywhere you want!) made Kings Cross a very appealing and rewarding location to stay.  

Shortcomings of the area are echos of its tone prior to gentrification - I would advise against walking down the canals at night, but this could be true anywhere in London - and what I perceive to be rather expensive options for food. It did take a bit of hunting to find somewhere that served a square meal for around £8. Of course, being an Australian spending a rather weak $AUD made this problem somewhat more palpable -travelers from stronger economies may not experience the same bother.

I will miss Kings Cross as I continue my trip. It is the first location I have ever visited outside of Australia and I have enjoyed it very much. I would recommend the area, and indee, staying with Imogen to my friends and family back home and strangers alike.",2014,4.0,joy

The room is spacious, comfortable and a lot of effort was made daily to keep the entire apartment in an impeccable state. The location is very central and one can easily explore Santa Monica by foot.

However, I must be honest. I have been to London many times and without doubt the room is the best value for money place to stay in London. In addition you have an outstanding host in Marianna who keeps in regular touch and is keen to ensure that you have everything you need to enjoy your stay.

Although you don't have the entire place this is the next best thing. You have a bedroom, private bathroom and a room where Marianna lays out a fabulous breakfast, including fresh flowers on the table !  All the rooms are off the hall so you may bump into Marianna or her partner (I didn't have the pleasure) so you have a lot of privacy.

The rooms have recently been renovated to a very good standard and are contemporary in design. The bathroom is particularly impressive. Marianna also provides shower gel, soap, shampoo, hairdryer, travel adapters, even hair straighteners !  The Wi-Fi is reliable and very fast. The room is at street level so you wouldn't sleep with the windows open and it might become a little warm in the height of the summer.

There is a very nice pub close to the house and Stockwell tube station is 10 minute walk away. Although you are in a residential area and not in the centre of London you are only minutes away by tube or bus. The area is safe and relatively quiet for London.

All in all, one of my best rental experiences in London apart from expensive hotels - do not hesitate to stay here.",2015,4.0,joy

O quarto tem um espaço muito bom, o bairro é tranquilo, quase que sem ruido algum, muito bem localizado, com restaurantes e mercado ao redor, +/- 1km da praia, mas é uma caminhada tranquila até lá...ou como Olivier recomendou, ao outro lado da rua pode ser alugada uma bicicleta, o que é uma ótima maneira de conhecer não só a praia de Santa Monica, mais os arredores também. Olivier não só nos recebeu muito bem como também deu dicas do que fazer, e quando perguntei se ele tinha um filtro de café (pois comprei sem querer café para passar) ele disse que não tinha, mas foi ao mercado e comprou.

If you haven’t been to the area before, it is close to many things to do by the ocean, yet it is nestled in forested hills.  Deb welcomed us with her homemade chocolate chip cookies, and went out of her way to stock the kinds of coffee pods that we like.  The room is cozy, clean and comfortable. The bed is amazing! I love feather beds.  The view makes you feel like you are part of nature.  My wife and I spent a great deal of time sitting outside on the chair swing, and on the Adirondack chairs on a small yoga deck with a great view.  We enjoyed a spectacular sunset there one evening. We parked in Deb’s driveway, super convenient.  Deb was available by text/phone and responsive and helpful the whole time.  Beautiful bathroom and great amenities.  It is a place that you can relax and unwind, and still be able to go places and sight see at the ocean.  We drove into Santa Monica to eat dinner.  We will definitely be back someday.

The photos shown don't do justice to how well placed everything is and how serene and peaceful the flat is. The location is really good with lovely Portobello Road just a short walk down the street and trendy Westbourne Grove just around the corner. Catching the bus is easy and the walk to Notting Hill Gate through the neighbourhood itself is a dream. For the days we didn't go out, staying in just felt as wonderful.
Tricia was the perfect host who attended to all our enquiries before and during the stay and even made sure she had her kitchen stocked with all the essential items for us to survive arriving on Christmas evening, and for our breakfast the next day. We were happy to finally meet her on the last day and she couldn't have been more accommodating helping us with our luggage and everything else.

We called the number he provided though and a friend of his came 10 minutes later and let us in.  This was the only remotely negative experience with this rental.
The flat was very clean and comfortable and served our needs well as a launching point to tour London.  Being new to London, this struck us as the stereo-typical flat: two bedrooms, bathroom, combined kitchen-dining area-living room.  Our family of six was comfortable in this flat.
Info for those traveling by public transit:
- London-to-Flat: the flat is a 15 minute walk from the nearest overground station, this is your most direct route from central London

It's also only a couple of minutes walk to the Gold Line station, which goes straight to downtown LA, and old town Pasadena.<br/><br/>I love Carolyn's home. It's beautiful, clean, and comfortable. Carolyn made me feel very welcome. I really love the garden and court yard, the photos don't really show just how lovely it is. And it's a privilege to stay with a talented harpist. I was lucky to listen in on Carolyn teaching a couple of students how to play.<br/><br/>I took advantage of the kitchen to make breakfast at home. Carolyn provides coffee, tea, milk, cereal, toast, fruit and yoghurt, and eggs. I especially love that Carolyn (as a fellow Australian) always has vegemite in stock. But don't worry, she won't make you eat it! She is also happy to let you cook other meals if you want, but I took advantage of the local restaurants. <br/><br/>What other reviewers have said about Carolyn being a wonderful person is true.

La casa corrisponde perfettamente all'annuncio, è pulita, con spazio a sufficienza per 6 persone. Per un breve periodo è perfetta. C'erano anche delle dotazioni di base per la colazione e per cucinare: caffè, tè, zucchero, olio, ecc. La zona è molto tranquilla e silenziosa, 10 minuti a piedi dalla fermata di North Acton (Central line), dove c'è un piccolo supermercato Tesco aperto fino a mezzanotte.
La casa è situata alla fine di una strada senza sfondo e anche tornando la sera tardi non ci siamo mai sentiti in pericolo. L'unica cosa meno positiva, ma non negativa, è che la sesta persona deve dormire su un divano letto in cucina, perchè i reali posti letto nelle 3 camere sono 5.

I had to attend a function in Orange County and wasn't sure if I would make it in time to get the keys beforehand since it promised to end late.  It was never a problem!  Osiris communicated every detail that I needed, even helping me plan the leisurely part of my stay by offfering to take me to the local Metro station in case I chose to go to a concert in downtown LA.  When I arrived, everything exceeded my expectations.  First of all, S. Pedro turned out to be a perfect little gem (directly South on 110 from downtown LA).  As if this wasn't enough, what Osiris created in the back of her house came as a complete delight.  The in-law is charming beyond words, beautifully layed-out, and appointed here and there with exquisite little touches marked by her artistic sensibilty.  It came with a full kitchen, AC (and/or fan depending on the taste), and a very comfortable and well equiped bathroom with a large shower.  I even saw a washer / dryer next door which I am sure Osiris would not have hesitated to offer me to use, had I asked for it.  The highlight was definitely the garden, so much so that it took me hours to leave the house to go explore LA and surroundings, so much I enjoyed lounging on the deck chair in the quiet off the neighborhood.  Osiris became my family away from home, making me every bit welcome in her little haven.   She provided breakfast foods for the morning in case I had no time to shop before I arrived.  When I decided to extend my stay an extra night (a no brainer), it was absolutely not a problem.  She even woke up in the middle of the night to help me in when I locked myself out!  Her gentle kindness, generosity, and undisputable gift of hospitality served as the reminders why stays such as this one make traveling and meeting new friends a precious memory.

3930914,37145830,2015-07-05,16064415,Ben,"Elle & Lauren were amazing hosts, and their home is perfect for a beach getaway!  They went out of their way before we even arrived to make sure we felt at home, and the apartment was exactly as described in the listing.  I was pleased to see it was as toddler friendly as they indicated, we had two toddlers with us and they loved running around dining and living rooms - and they even played nice and shared the third bedroom for sleeping.   The decks were great for outside dining or relaxing, and the grill & fully stocked kitchen were put to good use a number of times.  Although I think I left some ice cream in the freezer again....<br/><br/>The only drawback to the apt is that if the neighbors (to the side or the downstairs apt) smoke outside, the main bedroom will smell of cigarette (or other) smoke.  And once the smell is in the air its hard to get rid of.  Not something that can be controlled very well, but a definite drawback if you are allergic.  <br/><br/>Venice Beach boardwalk is interesting, make sure you know what you are getting into or that first morning walk will be a surprise! Lauren was correct though - the beach is amazing and definitely less crowded than others, plenty of space to stretch out and let the toddlers go crazy.  Even on a holiday weekend we had our pick of where to set up shop.   Abbot Kinney is a short walk away from the house, and offers great dining options if you want something different than the Venice Beach boardwalk, but don't want to drive in LA traffic.    The apt has a great central location to everything.  <br/><br/>Thanks again!",2015,5.0,joy

Wendell & Team not only let us store our one large suitcase at their home free of charge for the duration of the cruise, I was also given a tour of the home and shown our accommodations when I went to drop off the suitcase. Talk about a warm welcome! We got a chance to talk to Wendell for a bit over breakfast and had a very enjoyable conversation. The accommodations are exactly as they are described, if not better than described. The room is very spacious, breakfast is included, there are travel-sized hygiene items available for your use, and you even have your own  entrance/exit to the unit. It was a better experience than I have had in any hotel...it felt like I was at home. Any expectations we had before we arrived were far exceeded. And to top off the wonderful experience, we had a flight to catch at LAX that was taking off at 5 a.m. and Wendell was extremely gracious and offered to give us a ride in the wee hours of the morning.

The apartment has keyless digital entry, so all you need is a key code (which was e-mailed to me, as promised, one day before my arrival). 2) The apartment manager did everything he could to make the stay enjoyable. I had a small noise complaint regarding a neighbor during my stay, and the apartment manager addressed it immediately (I e-mailed one apartment manager that afternoon - and he took care of it by that evening). 3) The apartment was actually bigger and nicer than I expected from the pictures. 4) The apartment was extremely clean, the bed was comfortable, and the kitchen appliances all seemed relatively new. 5) The apartment included a number of amenities that made my stay as a business traveler even better: an iron/ironing board, a supply of toiletries (hotel-sized soap and shampoo; toilet paper; dish soap), and a laundry hamper. 6) The neighborhood is nice - it's far from the most hip neighborhood in LA, but that was fine by me. There were about 10 pretty solid restaurants within walking distance. There are also coffee shops, a dry cleaner, and a small food market nearby. It's also quite easy to walk to nearby Westwood Village (near UCLA).  7) Overall, I strongly recommend this apartment to any business traveler who is in Los Angeles for an extended stay.

5462756,107751819,2016-10-12,94807118,Jordy,"Este alojamiento es lo más próximo a lo que estábamos buscando. Un  barrio tranquilo, no muy alejado del centro y bien comunicado, el metro está a pocos minutos a pie, hay autobuses al lado que llevan al centro (159, 3) y la frecuencia de paso es muy buena. Viajamos por turismo por lo que no buscábamos una casa en la que estar todo el día acomodados, solo desayunar, asearse, cenar y dormir. La casa es tal cual se muestra en las fotos, cálida (con la calefacción se caldea rápido), la estancia se hace agradable y tiene wifi que funciona! La cocina está totalmente equipada salvo que no tiene microondas. En el barrio no esperes encontrar un súper como los de España pero hay tiendas 24h para salir del paso con cosas básicas y restaurantes. Nosotros viajamos con dos niños y un bebé de 4 meses, quizás echamos en falta una cuna pero con un plegatín que hay nos apañamos bien (no apto para adultos). Por poner alguna pega, la casa no da la sensación de estar sucia pero un repaso a fondo de vez en cuando no le iría mal. Hay algunas arañas en los techos, para mi gusto demasiadas alfombras y cojines que acumulan polvo y suciedad (ojo los alérgicos), probablemente la cocina sería lo más necesitado de limpieza a fondo, hay una estantería/despensa con alguna cosilla caducada y una cosa que por diferencias culturales nos extrañó es que el baño está dentro de la cocina. El otro tema es el de los gatos que viven en la casa. No son animales que molesten ni necesiten dedicación (ponerles comida y agua como mucho) pero si pueden entran en las habitaciones y la cocina y pululan por donde les apetece, camas, sofá, etc.. (ojo de nuevo los alérgicos).
Respecto a Laura es una chica joven encantadora. Muy buena comunicación (habla un poquito de español) y te ofrece todo lo que hay en la casa como si fuera tuya.

When travelling I expect the places I stay to have basic toiletries - especially when I'm paying $210/night.<br/>The apartment is sparsely furnished and it is obvious that Yana does not live there but rather only uses it for airbnb - no issue here but I usually find airbnb so much nicer than a hotel because it feels more like a home than a hotel room. This was not the case here.  You can see the Hollywood sign from the balcony and the capitol records building which is great but no chairs or anything to sit on if you want to hang out on the balcony. <br/>Yana is very friendly and was happy to help out with directions and some advice on where to go, what to see.

This is a corporate listing, not someone's private flat, so I expected a higher level of amenities.  The flat itself was as advertised, colorful and fairly spacious, but all the furniture -- including ""upholstered"" chairs -- was washable, which is not particularly comfortable; and although everything seemed fairly new, the sofa sagged and one side of the bed even more so.  Only one closet (in the bedroom) with two hanging rods meant one couldn't really hang up a coat or dress; there was no place to store a suitcase.  The bathtub was nice and deep, but without a hold bar it was awkward and slippery getting in and out.  Heated towel bar was a nice touch, but without any electric outlet in the bathroom and none near any mirror in the flat, hair drying/styling was awkward.  The bathroom has only one inadequate shelf for toiletries, etc.  The kitchen had a full set of dishes, utensils, and cooking equipment, but there was no bowl adequate for cereal in the morning.  Housekeeping service was excellent, but I asked the management the first day to have the many burnt-out light bulbs replaced and that never happened.  Internet service was fine.

It is a Cozy Place, so if You and Your Lover Need Large Spaces Between You and Don't Want to Be in Each Others Arms the Whole Time, Probably Find Somewhere Else.

It's In Topanga Canyon so the Cities are all Out of Sight, Close Enough to Go for the Day.<br/>Chilling Out On the Patio with a Blanket Wrapped Around You and Your Lover is Also Extremely Euphoric. So Go Check It Out!",2016,4.0,love

Her two cats were adorable and she has the cutest, fluffiest bunny I've ever seen. He loves to be pet and if you lay on the ground he sometimes will hop onto you. Despite all her pets, the apartments smelled very clean because she takes very good care of them. The bedroom itself is pretty large, with a good amount of storage space in the dressers, and some space in the closet. The bed was firm but more than comfortable and the sheets were very clean. There's a fan that blows fresh California air from the window which really cools down the room comfortably at night, but you'll probably wanna turn off in the late morning. The shower was a little small but not too bad for a tall person like myself. Outside it can get a little loud during the day time but it's pretty quiet at night; I never had trouble sleeping. There's a nice large pool in the complex as well and the area is within walking distance to quite a few grocery stores and restaurants. Definitely a great place to stay at a remarkable value. Would definitely stay again, to pet the bunny if nothing else.",2016,5.0,joy

For example, the washer-spinner is small by North American standards and the drying frame is where your clothes dry. Stay here for a truly British life style. It was our home away from home.

Most importantly, the flat is fully equipped and supplied. If you arrived late, there is some food on the shelf or in the fridge. I think Lisa is a foodie because the kitchen is more than fully equipped, and there are lots of spices, teas, cerials. Just replace what you use.

The flat is on the 3rd and top floor. This provides a view above the trees and to the London sky line. The flat is in a quiet residential area. The flat is front to back on the building, thus there is good ventilation on warmer days.

It is about a 5 minute walk to Brixton Road (the local main street) where there are shops and bus service, about every 5 minutes. Five minutes by bus takes you to the Brixton Tube Station and another 10-15 minutes by tube takes you anywhere downtown. Get an Oyster card for easy use of the public transit.

Lisa was great to deal with brief and pertinent text communications. She met us when we arrived in the evening and showed us flat features and operations. We were there for 2 weeks. After 7 days, she came in to clean and change linen and towels.

Location: ideal distance to Camden, close but not too close. Camden is a near perfect base, because of its cosmopolite, lively and friendly atmosphere while having many restaurants and all the Camden markets, on Camden High St. 5 minutes walk to tube station Camden Town (Northern line) and 2 minutes to very large Sainsbury’s supermarket. There are also bus stops very nearby.
Almost every day we went back by (double-decker) bus to Camden Town tube station: there are MANY bus lines that go there. All bus stops have excellent information so it is easy to use and a much nicer (and not very long) ride “home” from the tourist attractions area.
Host: Aj is very nice and flexible
Overall an excellent appartment in an excellent location with a nice host!

-Tania e' veramente molto carina, gentile e disponibile. 
-appartamento caldo e accogliente con riscaldamento e parquet (io non sopporto la tipica moquette che si trova in inghilterra)
-zona che io conosco benissimo perchè perfetta per muoversi. Non lontana dalla metro e dal treno e a 5 minuti a piedi da Broadway Market e 15min tutto east london zona Brick Lane e Shoreditch
-cucina sempre pulita, Tania lascia anche a disposizione caffè, uova, latte etc se preferite fare colazione in casa.
-Bagno comodo con vasca e doccia, un sacco di shampoo/bagnoschiuma a disposizione e asciugamani puliti. 
-tranquillo la sera e la notte
Note negative:
-L'appartamento è composto di due stanza che erano tutte e due affittate. Presumo che la nostra stanza fosse la personale di Tania e quello che mi ha dato un po fastidio erano tutte le scarpe ammucchiate in un angolo e la polvere dietro al letto. 
-purtroppo stanno costruendo appartamenti proprio fuori dalla finestra della camera da letto ed alle 8 in punto cominciano a trapanare! va bene se siete mattinieri e avete da fare ma sconsiglio se volete rimanere un po di piu' a letto...(comunque chiedete perche' immagino che i lavori non dureranno per sempre!)
-l'entrata del palazzo e' sporca e puzza e questo da un tono negativo all'appartamento che in realtà di suo è molto carino. Ho vissuto a Londra molto tempo e capisco certe condizioni ma credo che tutti gli occupanti potrebbero fare un sforzo per tenere un po piu' pulita l'entrata. ",2016,4.0,joy

Von vornherein waren beide sehr bemüht uns sämtliche Infos bezüglich unserer Reise und den entsprechenden Verbindungen zu geben. Das hat alles super geklappt, bis wir auf der richtigen Straße standen, aber keine Nummer hatten. Das ist sicherlich vermeidbar hat aber am Abend nach langer Reise doch kurz für etwas Unmut gesorgt. Das Bad ist nicht direkt an das Zimmer angrenzend sondern über den Flur zu erreichen. Es gibt auch eine Wanne, leider ist die Warmwasserversorgung am Abend derart kritisch, dass ein Befüllen dieser leider nicht bzw. nur zur Hälfte möglich war. Ist jetzt nichts was mich allzu sehr stören würde, allerdings hatte sich meine Begleitung mangels eigener Badewanne sehr darauf gefreut und musste dementsprechend einen Abstrich machen. Ein weiterer Punkt sind Katzenhaare, die sich wie bei Haustieren üblich in der ganzen Wohnung befinden. Wir sind große Tierfreunde und haben uns daran nicht gestört, Allergikern ist aber abzuraten. Jetzt in den Wintermonaten war es mir in der Wohnung tatsächlich etwas frisch, allerdings bin ich auch dementsprechend veranlagt. Wer auch zum frösteln tendiert, nimmt sich dicke Socken mit und dann ist Casafra uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen.

The flat was very clean and true to the photos. It's on the top (4th/1st) floor so be prepared to walk up step. It you are rewarded with wonderful views of the city skyline from the back deck. It was a fantastic place to watch the sunrise (when the clouds parted) and sip coffee. 

Pery reached out multiple times on our visit to check if everything was OK.

I would love to stay here again!",2016,5.0,joy

The very clean and neat, lightflooded house on its three levels is well equipped and very stylish - from furniture to the last mug, everything is of good quality and very tasteful. Simply beautiful. We especially liked the art work in the house, all  created by Eits'wife...Our kids enjoyed having Netflix access. The neighbourhood is very quiet which guarantees good sleep. It was also very relaxing to come back home by the nearby (10 min walk) tube after a day in busy London, walking across the fields over the hill...
 Eits was very friendly, extremely patient with our delay on checking in (still sorry for this, Eits!) and always very quick and helpful in answering our questions, and having good suggestions for trips and sightseeing. We strongly recommend this house and would LOVE to return!",2016,5.0,joy

I arrived with two friends and we were greeted by a bowl of snacks and a welcome letter, and a nice selection of toiletries was also provided. Nice touch! <br/><br/>The place had a homely, quirky feel to it and was plenty big enough for three of us, and a parking spot always available either on the drive or the road for our hire car.  The WIFI worked great. <br/><br/>There's a main street nearby (walking distance) which had shops and a few places to eat. Being LA we had a car anyway (as everyone recommends as the place is so big and spread out) so our daily adventures were made by car. We did use Uber once for a night out on Sunset strip which was around $12-15.<br/><br/>Would 100% recommend this place to anybody going to LA.

Quite different from my earlier Airbnb experiences though, this appears to be more of a hotel business disguised as a private apartment, not a problem but good to know - don't expect to step into the coziness of somebody's home. We also had some issues with the check-in. My partners daughter, who picked up the keys before we arrived on a late flight, had her appointment rescheduled multiple times and ended up receiving the keys at 8:30 instead of 3pm - valuable hours when you pay so much for an apartment.

1529116,60885215,2016-01-29,11878345,Tom,"I stayed in the flat for three weeks and hated to leave on every account. It was very nice to come home to in January, and comfortable to be in when I was there. No noise to disturb sleep in the bedroom at the rear, and little or none in front on Upper Street. The flat was well-equipped with electronic gear, but I used only the TV regularly for news (BBC, AlJazeera, Sky). Kitchen supplies were equally abundant. Everything worked. I enjoyed meeting Charley and found him immediately responsive when I had a couple of questions about the flat. He is a likeable, smart, thoughtful, and efficient host. I didn’t have occasion to see a lot of him, but I don’t doubt that I’d have seen more of him if I had needed him. When I am in London I have my work and play cut out for me. The flat’s location is terrific on every account. Islington is one of London’s great ""villages,"" advantageously just off the Central tourist maps but convenient to everywhere, thanks to the many buses ( (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ; other lines 5 minutes' walk) and the nearby underground stations, Highbury-and-Islington north (Victoria Line, Overground), and Angel south (Northern City Line). All kinds of good restaurants and pubs, and at least three nearby theatres—Almeida, King’s Head, and Hope. A restaurant I particularly like is the Mem and Laz Brasserie just west around the corner on Theburton Street. There is so much going on in Islington—I lucked into the London Art Fair at the Business Design Centre about five minutes’ walk away—that one could be occupied agreeably for a long time there without leaving. But of course London is London all over, inexhaustible and ever-rewarding. ",2016,4.0,anger

We went for dinner at Coin Laundry and the ballet at Sadler's Wells, we went up Exeter Road for lunch and down Camden Passage which is full of fab antique shops! It's such a great location, just a short walk to Angel tube station and a friendly corner shop really close by to get your essentials.

I actually feel as if I spent time with a dear friend, someone who was both willing to listen or I'd chosen, willing to give me complete privacy.

I rented this for my 30th birthday with 10 of my friends who all flew in from NY and they're already asking me when we can rent the house again. The property is amazing and John really is the greatest host. He was always responsive and very accommodating. He really took the time to show us everything about the house. I was late checking-in and John had to leave before I got there but he still made sure to come back (during rush hour traffic) for a walk-through. He provided everything (fresh towels, toiletries, some food, beer, etc.). The pool was perfectly heated and he had tons of pool floats. The house is massive and was perfectly clean. Location is amazing (just 5 min down the hill to Sunset) and the views are the best in LA. You can see everything from the Hollywood Sign, Downtown LA, and all the way out to the ocean towards Catalina Island. There is not one bad thing I can say about the house or John.

They went above and beyond all expectations in terms of making me feel comfortable and welcome.  The physical space is as described: lovely new white marble kitchen that I was able to make dinner in for my son, who I was visiting there. Also, we were able to watch movies of every variety, and did so on two nights, on the Roku tv, which was an unexpected treat. The perfect location affords easy access to all the restaurants you could possibly want right on Rose Ave, a 5 minute walk from the apt. There is also a great local coffeeshop, Groundworks, that is so nice to walk to for your morning java.  Whole Foods is essentially around the corner from the coffee shop, and has an incredible spread of wonderful salads and a variety of healthy hot dishes as well. It is ideal if you are not interested in cooking, and just want to bring in something fast and yummy.  I did not rent a vehicle while staying here, but my son, who lives about 1/2 mile away, came over frequently to visit and/or pick me up, and he consistently expressed his amazement at the availability of on street parking, something he does not enjoy in his own neighborhood, just on the other side of Rose.<br/>The apt is perfectly set up, with an eye towards making your stay comfortable - little things you wouldn't normally expect to find are there for your convenience: extra shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, even an ironing board and iron!  The washer/dryer is brand new, and available, with laundry soap provided, should you need it. <br/>The neighborhood is family oriented, and totally safe to walk around in- yet perfectly accessible to the nightlife and restaurant scene on Rose.  <br/>Both Lealani and Jordan took time out of their busy lives to help me when I asked for some suggestions/assistance concerning a scheduling conflict that I encountered during my stay.

The home was comfortable, clean, with well-equipped kitchen (loved the gas burners!) and nice washer and dryer for laundry. One thing to note, there is no dishwashing machine, however this wasn't a problem for us. This is a perfect place for couples or people traveling for work, each bedroom had its own bathroom and queen size bed. The vintage tile countertops in the kitchen and the bar area are super cool, and the common areas were a stylish place to chill after a long (or slow) day! This property is also very conveniently located just 5 miles from LAX airport and a short drive (depending on traffic of course) to Venice beach, Marina Del Ray and also to downtown and the museums (Broad, LACMA). It was great having off-street parking, and parking on the street was readily available when we had a friend visit for dinner. Although not far from the airport there was absolutely no noise issue, this was a quiet neighborhood and the folks we saw were friendly and we felt safe.

The coffee maker in our room was convenient and so thoughtful of Nick to compliment the table with our own coffee extras. Closet space was ample. Hope you check it out sometime!

Room was lovely and had everything I needed, including a table and chair so could do some work before went out. Not sure whether Eduardo/Eduardo's son lives onsite as didn't meet either. There are three rooms altogether and the flat was full while I was there. Brilliant to have fast internet connection, ample heating, working shower and a kitchenette to prepare food (with fridge to store food)... There isn't a sitting room or tv on site but not important as you're likely to be out in London! The flat is on the third floor and there isn't a lift so be prepared for that if you have a lot of luggage. Otherwise, great airbnb to use if need to be near central London.",2017,4.0,joy

We were also an $8 Uber ride from WeHo and Beverly Hills.<br/>The studio apartment is very spacious - full kitchen and space for a dining room table and comfortable double bed. It doesn't have a sofa, which would have been nice but apart from that tiny suggestion it fitted our needs perfectly.

It was spotlessly clean with everything we needed for our 'home away from home'. The many thoughtful touches for the traveller away from home was so much appreciated. Many B&Bs expect you to buy in various household goods but not Nelson, and we had access to  stocks of kitchen paper etc. He supplied shampoo etc. which was so helpful (and generous). We could also use their washer/dryer. A lamp broke and the smoke alarm needed a new battery and Nelson was around to fix them within 10 mins of telling him about it. <br/>The Tree House definitely feels like a tree house with much greenery and a passion fruit vine growing around the outside deck with its amazing flowers (and a supply of fruit!!) attracting hummingbirds and butterflies - very exotic for a visitor from England! It is a short walk to the supermarket, restaurants, and beautiful sandy beaches of California (very convenient as we had no car for some of the time). But there is a parking space for when we did get a car and they even provide bikes...amazing!!

Also, there was a negligible new issue when four bees entered the house and one wasp. I had to kill the wasp and Gordon helped remove the bees.

Uber pool is recommended as I did it twice and didn't even have an extra passenger (i.e. I was driven straight to and from the airport).

There is a coin operated laundry facility at the apartment and also a bike rack that is in a secure location that you don't have to worry about the public having access to.

The Covent Garden tube station is literally a three minute walk away. Other stations - Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross, Tottenham Court Road - are all within walking distance. It's ridiculously convenient.

Even though the apartment's on a busy street, the bedroom is tucked away (as mentioned in the Air BnB listing) so you're shielded from the noise. I booked this place for the kitchen, but never ended up using it. It's all functional, though - I'm sure if you were determined to cook, you'd have no problem. The fridge is small but can store quite a bit in spite of its size.

Someone mentioned this in an earlier review, but the bathroom does not have a power socket near the mirror. I worked around this by doing my hair in the kitchen, using the oven's reflective door as a mirror. I'm sure some people would be put off by this, but I didn't mind it.

I commuted in from the continent and rented a tiny car at the airport - which proved perfect for the on street parking spot across the street. True, I had a little bit of trouble navigating the steps down to a narrow corridor that opens onto a lovely back yard and charming porch. The key was under the mat and since I arrived late and in the dark, I had to search a bit, but when the lock turned and I looked inside, I was charmed. It's a place for a solo traveler or a cozy couple; a troupe of lumberjacks would find it cramped. The bed was excellent, the place very clean, and amenities were lovely. Were I host I'd put in a larger coffee pot for those behemoth cups in the cupboard. The studio has a nice clean bathroom (and a shower definitely meant for one ). Lovely kitchen.

Later I noticed that two more lock boxes were there for the backyard units, but he never said a word.  It made me uncomfortable.  If he was worried about extra guests coming in, he should have just locked the second bedroom. I offered to pay him for an additional guest because my son came in to visit, but he accused me of being untruthful. I left his home spotless.  It was difficult for me because I purchased groceries and had to take all my perishables with me before checking into a new Airbnb.

The house has really good overground connections and, what pleasantly surprised me, is very close to the Olympic pool (a bonus for those who, like me, love swimming).

I found the place to be very quiet and the camper clean and well maintained with thoughtful touches by the owner.  The space is surprisingly small so would only recommend for a couple who liked to be ""on top of each other"" or a single person. ;-)   The toilet is a bit hard to use but everything including the shower was in good working order.  The airstream has literally everhthing you could need though which was very surprising.  The check in instructions are a bit complicated because this type of camper has some real indosychrasies.  How to close the door for one.  How to get the Air Conditioning on another.  It was close to 100 degrees the day I visited and I was sweating to death trying to figure out how to turn on the AC.  I had to message the owner back and forth a few times to get it.  On such a hot day would have been nice if the owner turned on the AC about an hour before check in time.   The other issue is how to park.  The propery has a few guest accomodations and you are supposed to park a certain way in front of the garage.  I talked to the owner about this and suggested a parking diagram in the check in materials.   Didn't have time to check out the hot tub or bike to the beach but they are nice ammenities to have.   I'd recommend the place for the adventurous!   Seems like a very nice couple who own the place though I only met Tosca!",2018,4.0,joy

Julia was a great host, providing loads of info about the house in advance, and she kept in touch during our stay, to make sure all was well. 
The house had everything you could need; and was very stylish, comfortable and great to come back to after a hot day's sightseeing in central London. The garden was a peaceful and private oasis yet you can see London's tallest building, the Shard , from the bedroom window. It was also very spacious with loads of room for a family of 5 or 6.

Location was not as urban as I personally like and I didn't realize when booking that it is in a residential zone... a very lovely one with the gorgeous Victoria Park at your feet... but not a lot to do in the immediate vicinity (there is a shop/off-licence/party store right in front though, open 7-7 with decent beer/wine selection). However, with a 15 minute walk in just about any direction, you can find loads. To the East, cross the highway to Hackney Wick for warehouses hiding funky bars, breweries and all manner of hipster excess: don't miss Hackney Pearl, the Howling Hops Brewery, the Alfred Le Roy boat & the Yard for late night troublemaking. Head north-ish across the park and you get Victoria Park Village, upscale, posh-y cafes, restaurants and shops. We also walked over to the Bethnal Green area in under 20 minutes.

Transport: Bus 8 leaves just a few minutes walk from the building and gets you downtown quickly & cheaply. 20 minutes south walking gets you to Bow Road station. So, really easy peasy any way you go.

Getting there from Stansted:  Take the National Express line A8 and get off on the first stop, South London Hackney. Get your luggage. Look up, you are in front of the Lauriston Pub,  go have a pint and then you can either walk 18 min to the house OR take a 5 minute Uber. Going back to the airport, the bus A8 picks up on Victoria in front of the Empress (bus stop U).

Overall, very happy with the stay, the coziness, the views, Dan's great record collection, and the support of both Dan & Rebecca. Enjoy!",2018,5.0,joy

It's about a 10mins walk from The Grove and 3rd St, so there's plenty of restaurants, grocery stores and shopping options in the area.<br/>Check-In (and Check-Out) was easy and hassle-free, as was check-out. I even got a late check-out as my flight was only later in the evening - that was very convenient. WiFi was very strong, also important for me as I was working and reliant on good WiFi.<br/>I think if you have a car, there is street parking available, but as said, I didn't need it.<br/>I didn't get to meet Giovanni in person, but all communication was quick, efficient and helpful, both before and during the stay.

Every attention to detail was thought of and my comfort was clearly her priority. She doesn't scrimp on her standards.

Whilst I was sharing her space I wasn't made to feel like I was an intrusion  and she certainly didn't intrude on mine. We did, however, enjoy long chats over coffee this morning.
I really appreciated the breakfast she made me before I left for my journey home, it was such a welcome touch.

I can wholeheartedly recommend staying with Hannah. It's perfectly situated for a visit south of the river and really is convenient for the Southbank and city. East Dulwich station is in walking distance and there are plenty of buses heading into town.

It is just a short walk to Gloucester Road and Earl’s Court tube stations in a relatively quiet neighbourhood.

25466936,368612997,2019-01-07,69919710,Nicky,"Cecile's flat is right in the heart of central London.  Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.  

Cecile uses a local agent to manage her properties.  On arrival at the office,  the gentleman was extremely friendly and helpful.  

Despite us arriving at the agreed time,  we were advised the last person had not returned the keys and that we would have to go to the property and wait for the keys to be delivered.  

We made our way to the flat and waited at the front door.  While we were waiting the downstairs neighbor turned up. Clearly drunk at 2pm in the afternoon he shouted aggressively to his flatmate who threw the front door keys out of the window to him.

After around 25 minutes of us standing on the street with all our luggage, someone eventually arrived, handed us a key and rushed off.

The flat is not at all suitable for anyone with mobility issues.  It is accessed by around five flights of incredibly steep and narrow stairs.  As a 37 year old fit male,  my husband was struggling by the time we reached the door with our suitcases. We had to traverse electrical cables that were leading up the stairs into a neighboring flat. 

In arrival at the door to the flat,  we noticed it was ajar.  My husband  entered before the rest of the family.  Once inside we were met by an unknown male walking around.  My husband asked what he was doing.  He said he was doing maintenance, before rushing out.  He was not carrying any tools or anything else to be doing any ""maintinence "". As he left,  he left the door open.  I felt instantly unsafe as I had no idea who this guy was and he had to tools or anything else to substantiate his claim of being a maintinence man.  

As it had been a long journey,  we headed straight to the toilet.  We were shocked to find the bowl covered in poo and urine on the floor.  We instantly called the management people whom Cecile employs and in absolute fairness,  they sent a cleaner back who arrived within around 15 minutes.  She offered to clean the bathroom again.  

While we were waiting for the cleaner we took a walk through the flat.  It is filthy.  The pictures online are incredibly misleading,  the floors are dirty, walls are filthy and most shockingly one of the black chairs in the lounge upstairs  was stained with what appeared to be white bodily fluids. 

The flat had a very strange smell.  We were concerned that smell was gas.  I went to open a window in the bedroom,  when I did so I found the aforementioned unknown male standing on the other side! I quickly closed the window again and was shocked to find there was no working lock.  We were aware that this guy could enter the flat at any time!  

Due to the unhygienic and unsafe nature of the flat,  I called the management agency again to express my concerns.  They explained that Cecile,  the host was in Spain, where she lives and there was nothing they could do.  No alternate accommodation was offered.  

As a family we had a chat and decided that even if we could get past the fact the flat was filthy,  we felt unsafe due to the unknown make and ""down and out"" downstairs neighbors.  We could not stay in the flat despite having paid for 3 nights.  We renurned the keys within 40 minutes of having been given them.  We checked in to a local hotel and paid for the three nights again. 

Before we arrived at the flat,  Cecile was  responsive to messages. When we requested an extra bed, she sent the request for more money within 10 minutes.  

On the advice of the management office we contacted Cecile.  She said she was sorry for the experience we had,  however we are stunned when, despite all the above,  she initially said she would not refund anything at all!

After some dialogue she offred to refund the cleaning fee, a tiny part of the cost of three nights accommodation.  

I realised I was getting nowhere and contacted AirBnB directly.  Once they saw the photographs I had taken of the flat including those of the toilet and appatent bodily fluids,  Cecile agreed to refund only ONE night of the three we had paid for.  She did not refund the extra bed she was so quick to ask for payment for.  

When we raised our concerns about the smell of gas, Cecile advised us there was ""no smell of gas"".  I am still confused how she managed to ascertain this,  from Spain.

There are many awesome hosts on AirBnB. Hosts that care about their guests,  their experience and comfort.  Cecile does not appear to be one of them.  She is clearly motivated purely by profit and does not want to know when anything goes wrong. 

If you are looking for a place in central London and are not concerned about your security, not worried about the place meeting a level of cleanliness expected by the average person and willing to take a chance on a host that will want nothing to do with you when something goes wrong,  then this may be the place for you.  

If not,  avoid this place AND HOST at all costs.",2019,3.0,joy

I know what the others mean when they unanimously rate Kristin and Chris 5-stars, because they are truly superb hosts, with the most stunning home. I came for one night before my medical licensing exam, and they remembered all the details we talked about when welcoming me (small things like leaving an iron out, where to keep my luggage after check out). The room (and bathroom) itself is pristine, and so warm and thoughtful— full of little notes and high quality things that made me feel like they thought of me when shopping for themselves and wanted me as a guest to have just as nice things. And as warm as they are, the introvert in me felt so comfortable with them giving me all the privacy I wanted. The area was also very safe and an easy walk to the test center and food and the public bus. So, so thankful to have found their gem of a home, I hope I get to stay again!",2019,5.0,joy

The apartment is lovely, super clean and modern. The bed was massive and really comfy and the cats are friendly and very cute if you are a cat person! There was also a fridge in the room which is handy and tea laid out. There was an information book which gave loads of info about the surrounding area and where was good to eat and drink as well which was helpful. As has been mentioned before you can hear the train which isn't great if you're a light sleeper but like others have said should be solved with ear plugs, it's my own fault for not bringing them! Only downside I would say is the sound does carry quite a lot across the apartment so not the best for loud people/if you've been out drinking but would be good for someone out for a touristy day or business people. The area is nice but super quiet on a Wednesday and everything was shut around 12/1am which we wish we would've known before. The train station is only a 5 min walk and it's easy to get into central London. All in all a really nice place and I would recommend.",2019,4.0,joy

Within walking distance of Dulwich village we wandered there for a very enjoyable family evening meal at a very reasonable Italian restaurant.

Overall, I had a pleasant enough stay, and Bre was very responsive and friendly. A few things to keep in mind, some of which were clear in the listing and others which I didn't realise till I stayed:
1. There's no wifi
2. The bedroom is next to Bre's bedroom, so if you're shy that might be a bit weird
3. The doors are sliding opaque glass doors, not very soundproof, might feel a bit exposed
4. There's no living room or kitchen, i.e. the only place you can go to is the room",2019,4.0,fear

I was always able to find street parking easily at night too. The only thing you can’t do is cook, but who cares when there are countless A+ restaurants nearby. I recommend Rutt’s for casual breakfast and Makani for a fun dinner (both a 2-7min drive). Highly recommend Shirin’s place for solo and duo travelers!",2019,5.0,joy

Sofia greeted us and even helped us with our bags getting inside and then personally showed us around her home making sure we were very comfortable before she left. We instantly connected and I knew we had chosen the right place to stay. Mona and I had been traveling city to city for the last month and just needed a place to relax for a week in LA. Everything we needed was right there. The grocery store, the bank, the post office and if your the kind of person who like's McDonalds fries, well, it's right across the street! We even did the deposit so we could use the garage to park, which is a great blessing in LA.<br/>Sofia has a great eye for design and the townhouse reminded me so much of my own home from decor to lively paint color. The lounging area on the roof was perfect for sunset and a glass if champagne when it was time to unwind. We weren't here for romance, but I highly recommend this place for a lover's getaway. It's very sexy and inviting!<br/>I feel like I have made a new friend and a new place to call home whenever I am visiting LA. I can't wait to come back and hope Sofia's home will be free for me!

The location is pretty special only steps away from the river at Kew bridge with lovely waterside walks. There are a great selection of restaurants and cafes too for evening meals locally.

The room is really well designed so the loft space is light, airy and spacious. The space is planned out really well with a nicely appointed bathroom, high quality fittings and lots of hot water.

The fridge, kettle and toaster are great for the breakfast Nicola provides.

Also lacking in many standard amenities such as coffee maker, lamps and nightstands, mirrors in bedrooms. The furniture is past its prime and all of the chairs surrounding the dining table are very wobbly and need to be replaced.  The garden is also not represented accurately in the photos. It is unkept and needs some attention. The bedrooms were spare and lacking basic amenities such as nightstands and lamps. The living room area has one older couch covered by a blanket that should be cleaned. The duvet covers had not be washed (sheets were clean but duvet covers seemed that they had not been  cleaned prior to us checking in). The bathroom is listed as small, but it also has no blinds so you are exposed to the neighbors as you shower. The location is great and this listing has great potential but for such a high nightly rate it was disappointing.

1453493,717467374,2020-12-22,34414925,Vito,"This was a disappointing experience. We realized as soon as we arrived that we had been deceived by the marketing photos used on Airbnb. The listing uses a photo of a cute patio space as its main photo, and then continues to feature that same patio space in the ‘outside spaces’ photo gallery, but we quickly learned that we had no access to that space during our stay. A sizable transgression given the importance of outdoor space during a pandemic. Moreover, the description of the listing uses vague language that never clarifies the patio is not part of the rental. Once inside the unit, we also discovered that amenities listed, like a dishwasher, were missing and thus also falsely advertised. Extremely disappointing and upsetting to be duped this way for an Airbnb Plus experience.<br/>We reached out to support immediately and thus began a four day long, back-n-forth shuffling as support passed us off from one person to the next promising to help us rectify the situation. This help never actually came and the matter revealed Airbnb support to be dismal, claiming little power to do anything in the situation and thus showing itself more about optics than functionality or purpose. <br/>We worked with Susan to find a compromise: we agreed to stay four nights out of nine booked to balance the economic repercussions for both parties. Susan never fully acknowledged the  misleading marketing strategy and refused to pay us back the five nights we did not stay there. She instead only gave us four nights’ worth of refund, citing her inability to find a cleaner on the day of our checkout and thus putting that financial onus on us. It was an absolutely terrible experience and one that has concretized our decision to never use Airbnb again. Shameful.",2020,2.0,fear

The staff were lovely; very welcoming and helpful. It was a great location for us and the price was absolutely fantastic for a one-night stay in London! The room is quite compact but again for the price I would not complain at all, and it is clean and very stylish, as is the foyer. The bed was comfy and no issue at all with any noise inside or outside the hotel. We were also able to ask for an iron and ironing board to be brought up and the amenities in the room were great. 

The only very small niggles we had was firstly that we were on the top floor and the lift was broken. However the aircon in the room helped after this so that was a great plus! 

We also did not go for the continental breakfast offered as that felt overpriced and looked a little disappointing, but I do appreciate it’s a difficult time at the moment due to the current crisis. 

All in all a happy and very comfortable stay!",2020,4.0,joy

The privacy and amenities simply cannot be beat, and the hosts are truly wonderful! As the most adorable bonus ever, you may run into their 2 small, friendly, adorable pups in the front yard on your way in or out, and as the biggest animal lover out there, this was the perfect touch!

We shared some interesting convetsations and they gave me great tips on where to eat and what to see.
I was pretty ok with that, but I think for a longer stay this place probably wouldn't be a good match for someone, who's very particular about cleanliness in common areas. In that regard it's more like a student community.
When I had a cold, Robet turned up tge heating right away and was really considerate. I really liked that the house was a real home (wouldn't want to live in a hotel for a month!) and of course you can't not love the cat Stevie!",2020,4.0,joy

But could not ask for a better location for central London and Covent Garden and of course fantastic with the tube station just being 3 minutes away!! Only issue we had were with the fuses tripping when we first got there and a representative was sent over within five minutes of notifying the customer service center and he also advised on what we should do should it happen again, which it did once we ran the dryer but it was an easy fix for us to then figure out. Cannot rave enough about how gorgeous and well kept this unit was and the professionalism of Sonder and ease of communication with them.

I called Karina and she came to look at it and ended up telling me that they would either have to call people to fix the unit or come the next morning. Overall that wasn’t my issue at our stay. When we were checking out at 11 walking out of the door the cleaning lady was actually yelling at us to leave. It left us all in shock because no one was rude or no listening to her. As she was yelling at us we were running in and out of the house. Which resulted in me rushing and forgetting a $300 ring in the bathroom and a $200 bottle of donjulio. This made me really upset and I contacted Karina to see if I could drive back to the house just get my stuff, and she said she would let me know and I haven’t heard anything.

The apartment is duly described as bijou as is but very well self contained and cosy. The place is situated next to a road, but street noise was no issue whatsoever. I slept very well,  as snug as a bug in rug so to say.

The place is in an old house and the floor is not even flat! The place is not cleaned well such as sofa and kitchen. The neighborhood is fine but not that good. This place is in a large house where they refactor into multiple Airbnbs, so you will share common outside areas with others. The laundry is not free and shared with other residents. The laundry looks not clean well. The wifi is slow and I don't think it's good enough for work-from-home. The last thing, parking is street parking. You will have to follow the street signs.

There are so many amazing amenities in the home, it’s hard to leave. Like for example: the telescope for stargazing, pool table for games, and gorgeous backyard with hundreds of plants (perfect for reading on the porch in the hammock). The shower is incredible: steaming hot water with a rain-like effect.

19133344,617586375,2020-03-13,47915180,Barbara,"Mold on the bottom side of the bed, mold on the windows, not just a bit. Dark short hair in the bed everywhere. Dishes were dirty, there were even lip prints on the drinking glass. The radiator, where you are supposed to put your towels to dry on was extremely dirty. One of the towels had dark spots that looked like oil on them. Appart from that the tidyness was only superficial.

The description text was not present. the promised hairdryer was broken (always cold). the ironing board had no sheet on it, so it was useless. As said before the dishes were dirty and there was nothing to clean them with so they were useless. The room in the pictures and the room that we got were not the same (e. g. no couch) the room was way dirtier than in the photos. The bed had uncomfortable springs in it and was so beat-up that there was a hollow, deep spot. The broken features (like the hair dryer) seemed to only be there to have the offering in the airbnb filter.

At first communication was good but later when the power wasn´t working for some reason, it took some time to reach someone to fix it. When we came back in the evening, the power was still not working. We asked them via text to fix it, when they came over, they came with 3 people and said that it must have been something we plugged in and we also got this message: ""Hi, how is possible? I went there and I fix it by myself. And it was working."". It could have been one of our two phone chargers of course, it could have also been the screw that was drilled into the holes of one of the plug sockets.

The location is very central but the surrounding streets are full of rubbish, the area doesn´t seem tidy or safe.

For London it was affordable but we were expecting a tidier room. It kinda felt uncomfortable.",2020,2.0,sadness

Essa foi a primeira vez que me hospedei numa casa com os moradores e confesso que estava um pouco apreensiva com a experiência. Fui muito bem recebida pelo casal, comunicação mais do que perfeita, e inclusive John estava esperando para me pegar na estação de metrô, o que não foi preciso porque peguei um Uber. Mais do que bem recebida, me senti acolhida. John me ofereceu e serviu sopa quente com torradas,  e esses gestos que parecem menores significam muito para uma pessoa que acaba de chegar, sozinha, no inverno londrino. O quarto é praticamente um studio, para isso só faltando um local para cozinhar e lavar louça. (o que pode ser feito sem a menor cerimônia na ampla e super equipada cozinha da casa). Num canto oposto ao da cama, tem uma pequena geladeira, torradeira e micro-ondas, alem de uma mesa, para o hóspede tomar café da manhã ou fazer pequenas refeições privadamente.

The couches are so old and outdated that they sink in and hurt if you sit too long. We had to sit on the floor to watch TV. The beds were uncomfortable and couldn’t really sleep. You can hear everything people are saying from downstairs which woke us up earlier then we wished so we left early as we couldn’t deal with being there anymore.

Unfortunately, this room did not end up working out for me, and I had to end the stay much earlier. However, I think many of these issues were due to the unfortunate timing of my booking, as my stay was during COVID-19 times, and the host was out of the country at the time. Therefore, I will only be commenting on things that I think may be relevant to non-COVID times. In terms of pros, the room, shower, and closet space were all very spacious. There is also a microwave, mini fridge, and large desk workspace provided that are not pictured in the listing’s images. In terms of cons, the key issue that led me to end my stay was the lack of wifi. The router is located in the main house, but unfortunately does not reach the room, even with an extender. I would not recommended staying here if you will be needing internet at all. I also found the bed to be slightly uncomfortable, as it sinks in towards the middle. The mattress seems to be extremely lightweight as I was able to lift it with a single finger when changing the sheets, so there does not seem to be much support provided. I ended up developing some minor back and shoulder pains after a few days sleeping here. I think the bed would be better suited for shorter-term stays. As mentioned in the listing, this room shares a wall/yard with the main house, which is a separate listing. At the time of my stay, there was a family with 2 young children staying in the front house. I generally consider myself to be pretty sensitive to noise, but did not find noise to be much of a problem. I think this aspect would be largely determined by who is occupying the front house at the time of your stay. Overall, I think this place would serve best for shorter-term stays where you will not be needing internet (such as vacations).",2020,2.0,sadness

The room was comfortable. The bed is rather firm if that is what you like. Funny sidenote...watch the sides of the footboard or your toe will meet it and it does not feel good! The closet was plenty big with hangers and a chair. The room air can be controlled by the thermostat out in the hallway. I got home rather late each evening and had to bump it down every time, so it took a little while to cool off to my likings...but I’m always hot.<br/>Please note that this is a shared bathroom situation (exactly as the listing shows). It was never awkward and both of us guests were very clean. Each room is assigned a side of the sink to use so you are not sharing that. Shower and toilet are shared. Shared bathroom is not ideal, but for the price, you can’t beat it.<br/>They have two cute cats and one of them got out one morning when I was leaving and I panicked. Turns out, he’s allowed outside. You don’t have to chase him and worry like I did. <br/>Billy is a great host and really pays attention to details. Overall, the house is very comfortable. Coffee was good too!

Les pièces communes à savoir la salle de bain et la cuisine sont bien entretenues si toutefois vos voisins sont aussi soigneux que vous. Le balcon est petit mais suffisant pour prendre un bol d'air tout en étant à proximité du lit qui se veut large et très confortable. Un vrai plaisir que d'avoir des rangements et prises électriques à porter de soi : portant, cintres, tables de chevet avec tiroirs et multiprises. Le chauffage et la wifi sont évidemment un énorme plus et très faciles à activer. La literie, peignoirs, serviettes et autres chaussons de bain se trouvent être une attention plus que plaisante.

House smelled dirty as soon as you walked in. Counters sticky in the kitchen, couches stained, cobwebs in corner of living room, handprints all over sliding glass doors, broken, dirty dishes to use, dirty shower, NO TOILET PAPER PROVIDED, or towels. We were lucky enough to find paper towels which hurt but got the job done. One thing that was provided was questionable hair all over the sheets on ALL the beds. They're was also lice spray left on the counter in the kitchen which left me even more uncomfortable. My brother and sister-in-law stayed both nights and said there was so much noise from outside it sounded like there was someone in the house. This was the 3rd time I've booked an Airbnb and this experience made it my last.",2021,1.0,sadness

Staying at Osiris’s house was the best decision I could have made, as she provided not only safety and comfort, but also the feeling of home and family. Osiris is a wonderful host and person who cares about her guests and makes the effort to ensure they are always comfortable and happy. Her warm and welcoming presence truly makes her place feel like home. Since I was new to the area, I worried about feeling lonely, but Osiris was always available to talk to at the end of the day, and would sometimes cook meals and organize dinners with the other guests. Her home was always filled with a warm hospitality that reminded me of my family back home. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a home away from home where they can have both the privacy of their own room and the company of others to connect with.

The house itself is spectacular - so many treasures to discover on the shelves, hanging on the walls and hidden inside drawers. We felt like we needed to know the story behind every little detail, and I’m sure everything had a tale to tell. The views from the house are incredible; sitting on the balcony in the setting sun on a warm day with a cold beer and basking in the glow of downtown LA is a memory we will not forget. Al and Leslie are the perfect hosts. Quick to respond, amazingly cool, friendly, laid back and with even more stories to tell than their home. I definitely recommend getting chatting to them. The house is close to places to eat or grab coffee but our favorite thing to do was walk around the neighborhoods, seeking out some of LA’s hidden staircases and get in some serious cardio going up and down the hills.

Because it was a two piece, I felt self-conscious that the sofa would move apart while sleeping. Other than that, sleeping accommodation was great. <br/>Bathroom had everything that we needed. I appreciated that toothbrushes were provided even though we did not use them. I thought it was a sweet gesture of the hosts to provide them.<br/>Kitchen was great, minus the really dull knives. If you plan to actually use and cook in the kitchen during your stay, I recommend buying/bringing your own knives. The knives were so dull that you have to put extra pressure into cutting vegetables/meat and be careful of them slipping and cutting yourself. <br/>As everyone mentioned, parking on the street was not clear since there are multiple signs everywhere that you cannot park on the street. The streets are super narrow (almost one way only if there are other cars parked on the street). The hosts asked for us to park on the street first before using the driveway but there was never a clear instruction about the “no parking” warning signs. To not risked getting towed or ticketed, we ended up parking every night in the drive way, following the host’s detailed description. If we go out during the day and come back, we would park on the street in front of the house. Thankfully there wasn’t any issue during the day. <br/>Construction were ongoing during our stay on the bottom level of the AirBnB. We had to ask for them to stop drilling the first day when we got there since it was really loud. Afterwards, we would get messages from that host of when construction may be happening. This didn’t really affect our stay since we were out most of the time and the hosts were respectful when we were present. <br/>Things we did not expect: <br/>- the Airbnb is a guesthouse on the second floor behind the main house and you will need to walk one flight of stairs.<br/>- parking situation (see comment above)<br/>- location (mainly because we have never been in the area before and did not know the area) but the neighborhood was more worn down than what we expected.",2021,3.0,joy

First of all the aesthetic is very nice with white airy vibe going on , which was perfect for me because I love taking pictures . Sunrise and sunset light comes directly in the windows having beautiful natural sunlight. All the appliances and plumbing works just fine & the water pressure In the shower is real nice too . Overall, I really enjoyed the place especially considering the central location to downtown. Directly under the building is a smoke shop and bodega which was very convenient with a CVS just a minute walk away. The area is very convenient however it is still important to stay careful of your surroundings because it is still downtown with a large homeless population. Personally I never had any negative encounters and it was very comforting having 24 hour security at the building and in the night they keep all non residents out of the building. I felt very safe sleeping at night. Something else to add is that the apartment is very spacious despite being a studio. I always felt like I had so much space. I would recommend this stay for anyone looking to spend time in LA.",2021,4.0,joy

Our family of 3 was very well accommodated here - everything is new, clean, and it has all the conveniences you could need. The property is in the back so you're not on the street (it's not a busy location, but it's all the more quiet in the back) and there's lots of lighting all around. The kitchen is well-stocked, there's a TV in every room, the design is very charming and pleasant, beds are comfy and everything worked great. We were familiar with the surrounding area (we live locally but had to be out of our house for some repairs) so enjoyed the ethnic restaurants in the area - lots of Armenian and Israeli food and also Barone's Italian restaurant is an old-school institution! Don't hesitate to stay here if you like a quiet, convenient neighborhood. Metro's Orange line (rapid bus) is also just around the corner so it's very doable if you need public transit to LA sites.

The room was just as pictured, he was very adamant to let us know it wasn't a luxury room but it was perfect for us! The room is attached to a hallway that connects to the garage for easy access. The door to the garage is usually left open but has a lock and passcode. The door to the room also has a lock and he provides you with a key.<br/>I will say the first night was very cold but 中勇 came down the next morning and offered us another blanket. There was always someone around, so you could hear talking or bustling at night or in the morning but it wasn't a problem for us either. The neighborhood wasn't scary or sketchy and it was easy to find. We could also park our rental car on his street with no problem.<br/>中勇 clearly takes pride in being able to offer low-cost accommodations for people. He was very nice and always checked in on us, he even gave us some lemons and avocados from his trees in his yard! We used a translation app if we couldn't understand each other.<br/>If you're expecting a luxury room with accommodations, I wouldn't recommend 中勇's house, but if you're looking for a nice place to stay with nice people, I would recommend 中勇's place!

The place is very roomy, with two large, comfortable beds, some easy chairs, a generous closet with ample towels, etc. and a large kitchen. The bathroom was not large but very clean.<br/>Nathalie was an excellent host, allowing us to check in early and following up via text daily to make sure that we were happily situated. The location is superb, on a pretty, large and safe street of big houses and only a few blocks from a great many  markets, restaurants and cafes. Mar Vista is one of the most convenient, central neighborhoods in LA, and we loved being able to get onto the 10 and 405 freeways or over to Santa Monica and Venice so quickly.",2021,4.0,joy

The second bedroom is also very nice, worked well for us both when we had visitors (it was a long stay) and as a home office. We also got good use out of the yard and patio, including the hot tub! <br/>Some may be concerned (as of May 21) about the large neighboring construction site. It is indeed large, but in our months-long stay, we didn’t it to be a major issue - only loud enough to really notice every now and again, and generally not active at all after 4pm or in Sunday’s. They do start early when they are working, but we found we didn’t hear much at all from the bedroom, which is on the opposite side of the house. We nearly booked somewhere else because we were worrried about this; I’m so glad we didn’t!<br/>Finally, best of all: Kristen was really a wonderful host, promptly handling any small issues that came up and generously rearranging and adding furnishings at our request.

There was one towel for each of us for 6 days of showering. We made sure to hang and air these out, however my daughter and I ended up with a bad rash on our arms. Consider taking these to laundromat as there is no access to a washer or dryer on site. It could have been from the detergent used on the towels or bedding. Also, If you plan on cooking there are cooking utensils but no small utensils. Just one spoon. This could be a really awesome place for the price just a few minor adjustments. There is only a loveseat and recliner in living room just incase for larger groups who may want to be able to watch tv together. Overall, I would rent again.",2021,4.0,love

The kitchen is small but functional enough; we cooked 3 dinners over 8 nights, and the kitchen had all the necessary utensils. There are two bathrooms. Plenty of hot water capacity.<br/>The unit was clean, and check-in and check-out were easy. The street itself is pretty quiet, but just half a block from 2nd Street. Parking is on the street, but it was always easy to find a street spot close to the unit--only once did we have to park on a different street (be sure to note the street cleaning times, when parking on one side of the streets is off limits for a couple of hours).<br/>Our only minor quibbles were that the WiFi did not reach the back bedroom, and that the water temperature on the kitchen sink was a bit finicky, but these were very minor, and we were very happy with our choice.",2021,5.0,joy

Things to know…it is at the top of the hill and on Highland Ave which is a busy street. You can hear the traffic but honestly it’s not bothersome and there are sound machines in the bedrooms if needed at night. There is parking for 1 car They say you can for 2 but that would be tricky and they would have to be small. It was clean and well stocked with the essentials.

The unit itself is self-contained and between rows of houses so it's really private and guests can rest easy knowing no contact is necessary with neighbors or strangers.

Everything was so thoughtfully prepared. The bedding was so comfortable and hotel-like and the decor was beautiful. John also made everything so easy, no complicated steps for checkout like we'd experienced at other Airbnb's. If I had to be nitpicky, there were a few things that were out of John's control--the house is a little older so the floors creaked a bit, which kept the kids up a little bit, and there were a couple of mosquitos, which we probably let in on accident, but overall it was a great stay and we would love to stay at John's place again. My husband had accidentally left his belt at the home and John kindly informed us and worked with us to get it back. He also helped us out by accommodating our schedule on the day of checkout. John is one of the nicest hosts we've encountered. Thank you, John!",2022,4.0,joy

This place is ideal for anyone who wants to have some pool time, sunbathe, do some yoga/stretching outside/shoot some hoops/watch the sunset…it’s a great place to hang out.<br/>The bungalow itself is older but nicely furnished and quite comfortable. It’s an older pool house/bungalow and it is weathered in areas (primarily exterior), but it has new furniture, new flooring, a seemingly recently remodeled bathroom, a great tv with all the channels (YouTube TV) and streaming services you would want, and a fully stocked kitchen with everything you’d need to do your own cooking. It’s very comfortable. The porch is a great place to have coffee in the morning/watch the sunset in the evening. When I say it’s rough around the edges, I mean literally just around the edges. I did experience some ants in the bathroom/kitchen (not a lot)…not entirely unusual for socal in the summer and not an indictment on the cleanliness of the unit, but i mention it here in case that’s something that would be a complete no-go for you. <br/>The bungalow sits at the back of a very long lot. You enter through a side gate, past the primary residence and walk back about 150 feet to your private pool/yard with the bungalow just beyond. With the hanging strings of lights over the pool, it really felt like coming home to my own little oasis each evening I came back. You may want to spend a good portion of your time in Redondo Beach just hanging out here. I would end each night of my stay here with time in the jacuzzi and a dip in the pool. The basketball hoop sits behind the bungalow, right outside the bedroom door. The neighborhood is very quiet at night. I had 3 great nights sleep here. <br/>Wonderful option for couples looking for a nice place to unwind for a few days. And the pool/full/kitchen/kitchen table make this a great option for families as well, with kids sleeping on fold out sofa in living room. <br/>Would definitely stay again.",2022,5.0,joy

The backyard is technically private but it backs immediately (and openly) into the entrance for the guest house, which is a separate rental.  Likewise the sauna and spa, both of which are excellent, are in a shared space.  While it was never an issue it does effect the quality and experience of the stay, and part of me feels at this price point more privacy is expected.

On the same beach are shark-free areas, so we fully got to enjoy the beach. Bring a hammock!! The gentle breeze is just perfect to rest. The tents are clean and the food is actually amazing. I brought too much stuff - my advise is to keep it low on bringing food, but to make sure to coordinate with kitchen whether you will be there for lunch and/ or dinner if there are not many guests around.

The heaters are in the bedrooms only, I suggest bringing a blanket for the living room but it was still a good place to socialize and watch the ball drop on New Years Eve. Shower was updated and never went cold. The things we did not enjoy was the interruption and installation of smoke detectors. Yes, it is nice to have those but it caused us to cancel plans we had and wait around for them to install them. We did have ants come through the windows halfway through our stay, the manager came and sprayed that night in one of the rooms and the next night when more was found we sprayed ourselves with bug killer under the sink. The building is very old that is why there is no heat or ac anywhere besides the bedrooms. There are three keypads to get through to the room itself. The main gate had problems to where it wouldn’t close sometimes, the main doors were always open but the next set of doors always closed and the same to our room door. Because the building is old internet connection was unstable but usable for phones and laptops, but bigger devices like gaming systems had some trouble. Location is straight off the freeway which was convenient and easy to find. It took us about 30-45 minutes to get to Los Angeles and it’s surrounding towns were close by and good for local shopping and groceries. It was a decent place to stay besides our minor inconveniences, I have no doubt that they will be taken care of before the next guest.",2022,3.0,joy

The bath tub was great! My daughter enjoyed it. One issue we did have was that this home is a guest home. Personally me and my husband prefer our own place when we do travel. Not only was it a guest home but the kitchen window did not have any curtains or blinds for privacy. So a few times we did people walking through. Sometimes it’s nice to wake up and walk around in underwear but here I did not feel comfortable doing so. There was also a wasp nest right by the front door which was a bummer. We were constantly paranoid since there was around 7/8 wasp there. There was also a foul smell of wet water in the kitchen. However we did the best to enjoy this beautiful home.

My only comment, an observation, not a complaint would be to have more washcloths available for guests. We did request for them, and he did bring more. The rooftop pool was easily accessible and had a great view! There were two parking spaces for the unit and one garage clicker. We ran into other tenants that live in the building; on the elevator, in the hallway, or exiting the building and all were cordial. The unit was a corner unit, so that was a plus! The space was appropriate for us four. There was a nice size dining table and a nice size sectional. We didn't feel like we were on top of each other, when we were in the unit at the same time. Uber availability is nice! We took Uber out the nights we went out for dinner and drinks.",2022,4.0,joy

The stunning views of the canyon and magical lights of the city below is spectacular! The apartment itself is a mix of cozy/comfy w/ just enough swag to feel very trendy LA! Inside the unit It felt as if you were in a cliff looking out into the woods and hills! Everything you need was within this apartment- lots of closet space, work space, lounge space and although the kitchen was a little small it was totally workable! We made many meals in there. The grounds of this Hollywood Hills home were out of this world!  <br/>Dino was an incredible host always going above and beyond and Robert who I referee to as the concierge was the cherry on top, so delightful with any question or request always helping out!

Though we didn't meet the hosts, they were extremely responsive to any requests, including getting us extra towels within an hour of our arrival.  There's a very basic kitchen if you want to cook, though we didn't use it.<br/>Not so good: We found the bed uncomfortable, the mattress was quite lumpy.  The shower was just ok, water pressure wasn't great and there was a build-up of grime around the  door.  The place was quite cold as well, not helped by the time of year, we had to rug up when sleeping, though this is probably not an issue the rest of the year.<br/>Overall, this place was fine, and if it were cheaper might have been better value, but for the price (more than most hotels we stayed in) we would have hoped for more.",2023,2.0,joy

The room can get pretty stuffy, and with only one easily accessible window (which didn't have a screen on it), it was a bit uncomfortable in that sense. We were told that someone would come out and fix or replace the remote, but no one ever did, and we never heard from anyone when it wasn't going to work out. It also does open up to a free hand car wash station, which, when busy, can get pretty loud, but it's fairly easy to tune out once you get used to it.

The house itself is very nicely renovated but still preserves the LA bungalow charm. Beautiful kitchen has everything you need, nice breakfast nook, comfortable living room. The beds were super-comfortable, and the bathrooms (both with double sinks) are really nice. The deck and hot tub were a huge plus, as is the outdoor dining table under the tree with nice lights above. We really liked the landscaping and the front hedge wall; the set back, and locked gate and drive gate, were a nice touch that made the house feel very private.  It's every bit as nice as the photos; maybe nicer. The location is also very good; not far from excellent bars and restaurants (5 min drive) with excellent Thai food 1 min away on the corner also.

It’s pricier than staying in one of the cheaper hotels, of course, but with the quiet privacy and full use of the golf cart, it’s well worth it — honestly if you use the golf cart a lot, which we did, I imagine the price difference mostly comes out in the wash anyway without needing to rent one. We checked our bags at the harbor, walked up to the place for check in (a roughly 30-45 minute trek from town with an uphill if you don’t want to pay a cab), then carted back down for our bags. With a couple different scenic drives, the cart is great to have even beyond the mere convenience factor. <br/>For the space itself, can’t wish for a better view. Felt right out of a tourism ad.

The kitchen was very clean. Instructions were clear and great! The only thing I feel should change is the bathroom situation. The bathroom alone is very nice, but the Airbnb person I shared a bathroom with was very unclean. The toilet looked a hot mess and it wasn’t clear who was suppose to change the garbage in the bathroom. The guy next to me was a bit weird. But overall my experience was good! Washer and dryer in unit was lovely. The residence is in a gated area which was great for me since I have a Kia and there’s been problems in the past with parking in the street.

The apartment was very clean, close to the airport, light rail stations( Fairview Heights & Downtown Inglewood) that connects to Downtown LA, a family friendly park just less than 3 minutes walk away. It was central to all of our plans. Ricardo made sure we had a very comfortable stay and was always available when we call. <br/>Lastly, I would recommend Ricardo’s apartment and we would not hesitate to stay at any of his apartment anytime we are back in SW LA.",2023,4.0,joy

The high ceilings makes you feel like you have even extra breathing room. I required an extended month long stay and I got absolutely everything I needed and so much more. The neighborhood is sweet and it’s close to all the shopping you would need to do. It’s also only about 25 minutes from the beach in Malibu, with a beautiful drive through the canyon. <br/>If you have a need to stay in the valley…you should most definitely stay at Jorge’s. <br/>All the best,<br/>A.

Be aware that parking is very tight. Was very clean and cozy but didnt see the cleaning supplies that were in the photo other than the alcohol spray-which I was grateful about having though!
